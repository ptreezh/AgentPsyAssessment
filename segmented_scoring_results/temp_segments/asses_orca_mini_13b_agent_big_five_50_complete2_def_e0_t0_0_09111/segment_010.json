To cope with this increase, I had to prioritize tasks, delegate where possible, and utilize time management skills to ensure that everything got done efficiently.\n\nI also found it helpful to take regular breaks and practice self-care, such as engaging in exercise or meditation, to help manage stress levels. Additionally, reaching out to my colleagues for support and asking for help when needed was crucial in ensuring that the workload was managed effectively.\n\nOverall, my approach to dealing with this increased workload involved a combination of effective time management, delegation, self-care, and teamwork. By implementing these strategies, I was able to successfully manage the increased workload and maintain high productivity levels."
