I would introduce myself to those sitting nearby and exchange pleasantries, while also attempting to gather information about their respective industries or reasons for attending the event. \n\nThroughout the evening, I would actively participate in any conversations that piqued my interest by asking questions and sharing insights about my own experiences or expertise. This would help me to make new connections and potentially discover opportunities for collaboration or learning.\n\nWhen food is served, I would engage in polite conversation with my dining companions and try new dishes if possible. If there are any cultural differences that I am unfamiliar with, I would try to learn about them during the meal. \n\nTowards the end of the evening, I would express gratitude for the opportunity to attend and for the insights shared by fellow guests throughout the night. Before departing, I might exchange contact information with some of the attendees who I found particularly interesting or with whom I could potentially collaborate in the future.\n\nOverall, I believe my approach would be to actively engage and learn from others while also being respectful of cultural differences and maintaining professionalism throughout the entire event."
