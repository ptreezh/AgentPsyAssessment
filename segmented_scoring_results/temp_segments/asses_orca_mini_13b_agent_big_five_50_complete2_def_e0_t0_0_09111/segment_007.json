It will require adapting to a completely different way of working, which could be time-consuming and stressful. Additionally, there is always a risk of facing technical issues or encountering difficulties in understanding the new tools.\n\nDespite these concerns, I am committed to embracing this change and actively participating in the training and implementation process. By staying open and flexible, I believe that our team can successfully adapt to the new workflow, ultimately leading to enhanced productivity and better outcomes for our projects."
