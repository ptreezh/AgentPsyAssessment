      "extracted_response": "To begin with, you need to approach the situation with a calm and collected mind. It is essential to maintain control over your emotions and focus on delivering your message effectively. As an AI agent, I suggest that you can do so by using a more confident and assertive tone of voice while maintaining eye contact with your listeners.\n\nTo ensure effective communication, it is important to follow the group's communication guidelines and avoid any potential biases or conflicts. You may need to adjust your approach and be more flexible in order to cater to the diverse needs and perspectives of your team members. However, it is essential to focus on the core message you want to convey and avoid getting sidetracked by irrelevant details.\n\nIn terms of your report, you should prioritize the most important points while also being sensitive to the audience's emotional state. You can use active listening skills to gather feedback and re-engage the audience's attention. By doing so, you can help them gain a new perspective and make sense of the information presented."
