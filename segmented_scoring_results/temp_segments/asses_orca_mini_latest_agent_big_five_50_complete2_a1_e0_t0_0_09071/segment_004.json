Unfortunately, the results may be low in quality.\n\nIn response to this situation, your reaction and actions would depend on your assessment of the situation. It could be that you feel frustrated or annoyed at the lack of consistency in the folder labels. Alternatively, you may choose to continue with the task and find any relevant information within the folder to avoid any potential issues later down the line. \n\nOverall, it seems that the task is not easy and requires a level of patience and perseverance to complete successfully."
