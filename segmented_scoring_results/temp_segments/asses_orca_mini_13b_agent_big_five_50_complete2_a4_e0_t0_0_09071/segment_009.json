      "extracted_response": "In order to begin building my social circle in a new city, I would first try to connect with people who share similar interests or hobbies. Joining a local meetup group, taking a class at a community center, or joining a sports team are all great ways to meet new people and potentially make long-lasting friendships. Additionally, attending events or gatherings in my neighborhood or at local cafes can also help me connect with others. It is crucial for me to be open, friendly, and approachable while engaging in these activities, as this will make it easier for others to approach and include me in their social circles as well. Furthermore, actively listening to the experiences and stories of those around me, showing genuine interest in their lives, and offering help or support when needed can further strengthen my relationships within this new community."

      "extracted_response": "As the assessee, David Chen, I would likely prioritize teamwork and collaboration even if it means taking on more difficult or time-consuming tasks. This is because my core values involve connecting with people and maintaining team harmony. Therefore, I would assign tasks in a way that ensures both team members feel equally valued and invested in the project's success. \n\nTo achieve this goal, I might suggest dividing the work based on each person's unique strengths and interests, rather than simply assigning the most difficult tasks to myself. By doing so, we can both learn from each other's approaches and expertise, ultimately resulting in a more well-rounded and successful final product.\n\nIn summary, my instinct would be to share the workload fairly, even if it means taking on less desirable tasks, as this aligns with my core values of cooperation and team harmony."

I may also seek support from trusted colleagues or mentors to help build confidence and prepare for the presentation.
