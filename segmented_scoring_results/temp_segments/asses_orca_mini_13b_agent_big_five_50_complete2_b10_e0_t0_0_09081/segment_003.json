To cope with these feelings, I might try to focus on learning as much as possible by actively participating in conversations and asking questions about different industries and experiences.\n\nDuring the event, I would likely:\n1. Approach individuals who appear friendly or approachable, introducing myself and expressing my interest in their industry.\n2. Listen attentively to conversations, taking notes on interesting points or insights that could be useful for future learning.\n3. Ask questions about different industries, showing curiosity and a desire to learn from others' experiences.\n4. Share information about my own industry if the opportunity arises, demonstrating that I am also an expert in my field.\n5. Exchange business cards with new acquaintances for potential future collaboration or networking opportunities.\n\nOverall, while feeling anxious at first, I would strive to make meaningful connections and learn as much as possible during the industry networking event."

I told myself that there would be other opportunities in the future where I could present my ideas, learn from this experience, and grow as a professional.\n\nAt the same time, I couldn't help but feel a bit frustrated with the evaluation process and the people who rejected my proposal. However, I quickly reminded myself of my core values and tried to maintain respect for those involved in the decision-making process.\n\nThroughout the day, I continued working on other projects and tasks, ensuring that I didn't let this setback derail my progress. I also took some time to reflect on what went wrong with the proposal and how I could do better next time. This reflection allowed me to internalize the lessons learned and grow from the experience.\n\nIn summary, after having my project proposal rejected at a meeting, I felt disappointed but tried to remain positive by focusing on future opportunities for growth and development. At the same time, I struggled with frustration but maintained respect for those involved in the decision-making process, and used this experience as an opportunity to learn and grow from my mistakes."
