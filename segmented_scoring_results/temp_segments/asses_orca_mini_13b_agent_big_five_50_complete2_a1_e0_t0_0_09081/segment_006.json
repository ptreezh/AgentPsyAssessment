While modern art may create a pleasant atmosphere in the office, it should not be prioritized over other functional or necessary expenses.\n\nTo make an informed decision, I would request a cost-benefit analysis to be conducted, evaluating both the potential improvements in employee morale and overall productivity against the financial investment required for these art pieces. If the benefits outweigh the costs, then it may be acceptable to proceed with the purchase of modern artwork. However, if there are more cost-effective ways to improve office environment without compromising on functional needs or financial stability, I would suggest exploring those alternatives first."
