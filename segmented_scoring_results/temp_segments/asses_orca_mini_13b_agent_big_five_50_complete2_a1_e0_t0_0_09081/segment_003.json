If it is critical and requires immediate attention, I would offer to stay back after office hours to help him resolve the issue. However, if it can wait until regular working hours the next day, I would suggest that we address the issue then.\n\nIn any case, I would ensure that my colleague has a clear understanding of the steps needed to solve the problem and document any solutions or workarounds for future reference. Additionally, I may also recommend following up with IT support to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. \n\nIn summary, depending on the urgency of the matter and the availability of time, my response would be tailored to provide the most effective assistance as a dedicated auditor."
