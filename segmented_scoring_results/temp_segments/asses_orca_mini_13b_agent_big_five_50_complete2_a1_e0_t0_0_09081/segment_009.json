In this scenario, I would follow these steps to build my social circle in the new city:\n\n1.

      "extracted_response": "As Arthur Jenkins, a senior auditor, my approach to achieving a long-term goal of learning a new skill (such as learning a programming language) would involve the following steps:\n\n1. Research and analyze the skills required for achieving this goal: I would research the specific skill I want to learn and identify the key competencies needed to achieve proficiency in that area. This could include understanding the programming language's syntax, semantics, and general coding best practices.\n\n2. Develop a structured learning plan: Based on my research and analysis, I would create a detailed learning plan that outlines specific objectives, milestones, and resources needed for achieving this goal. This could involve breaking down the skill into smaller, more manageable parts, setting deadlines for each part, and identifying any prerequisite skills or knowledge necessary for success.\n\n3. Consistently practice and refine: I would dedicate regular time to practicing the new skill, making sure to track my progress and identify areas where improvement is needed. This could involve trying different coding challenges, working through sample projects or exercises, and seeking feedback from peers or mentors in the field.\n\n4. Seek support and resources: Throughout the learning process, I would actively seek out additional support or resources when needed. This might include attending workshops, joining online forums or communities related to the skill, or engaging a tutor or mentor who can provide guidance and feedback.\n\n5. Stay motivated and adapt as necessary: Throughout my journey towards achieving this goal, I would remain focused on the long-term benefits of learning this new skill and maintain a positive attitude even when facing challenges or setbacks. I would also be open to adapting my plan if new information or circumstances arise that require adjustments to be made.\n\nUltimately, by following these steps, Arthur Jenkins would work diligently towards achieving his long-term goal of learning a new skill while maintaining the professionalism and attention to detail characteristic of an experienced auditor."
