What is the prompt about?\n\nFor example:\n\n* **In AI and machine learning:** A prompt is a text input given to an artificial intelligence model as instructions or to get it to generate something like text, code, images, or other content.\n* **In creative writing:** A prompt can be a writing exercise that provides a starting point for a story, poem or other piece of writing. It could be in the form of a sentence, question, image, or an interesting scenario. \r\n* **In any communication context:** A \"prompt\" is simply something that prompts someone to do something or gives them a reason to respond.\r\n\nPlease provide more information about the specific prompt you're interested in so I can give you a proper answer!"

      "extracted_response": "The last thing I remember is being in my room, sitting at my desk. It was a rainy afternoon and the sound of raindrops against the windowpane provided a steady rhythm to the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the corner. I had just finished writing the final sentence of my novel and leaned back in my chair with a sigh of satisfaction. The story had consumed me for months, pouring out of me like water from a burst dam. Now that it was complete, an emptiness settled over me, leaving me feeling strangely hollow. \r\n\r\nI stood up and stretched, my limbs stiff from the long hours spent hunched over my desk. I glanced at the clock - 3:14pm. My stomach rumbled in protest, a reminder of how long it had been since I last ate. \"Time for lunch,\" I mumbled to myself, pushing away from the desk and heading towards the kitchen.\n\nAs I entered the kitchen, the room seemed cold and dimly lit by the sliver of sunlight poking through the blinds. The air was stale, as if no one had been in there for hours. An uneasy feeling crept up my spine and I paused, head turning slowly to look around. Everything appeared normal at first glance - dirty dishes piled in the sink, a forgotten sandwich on the counter, mail scattered on the table. But something felt...off.\n\nI took a tentative step forward, then another, until I was standing right in front of the refrigerator. Reaching out, my hand passed through it as if it weren't even there! My eyes widened in shock and confusion. How could this be? The fridge was solid moments ago when I had walked in here...\n\nPanicked now, I whirled around to look for any sign of what might have caused this strange occurrence. Suddenly, the front door slammed shut behind me with a loud bang that echoed through the house. Frozen in place, I turned slowly towards the sound, my heart pounding in my chest like a trapped bird desperate to escape its cage.\n\nBut when I reached the doorway, there was no one there except an empty hallway leading up to the second floor and down to the basement stairs. The room seemed to be filled with a heavy, oppressive silence that pressed against me from all sides, smothering any sound of footsteps or breathing. It felt like I was standing in the middle of nowhere, yet still somehow bound to this place by some invisible force.\n\nI wanted to scream for help, but no sound came out. My mouth had gone dry and my throat felt constricted as if a hand were squeezing it shut from within. Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes and I blinked them back furiously, refusing to let myself cry in front of this...this thing that had just trapped me here with its unseen presence.\n\nSlowly, agonizingly slowly, I forced myself to turn away from the door and take a step towards the kitchen again. But as soon as I did, the room seemed to shimmer and warp around me like a fun house mirror, distorting my vision into a dizzying kaleidoscope of colors and shapes. I pressed both hands against the wall for support but it vanished beneath my fingers, leaving me stumbling blindly through darkness until finally...\n\nI woke up in bed, gasping for air as if I had been holding my breath for far too long. My heart raced wildly in my chest and cold sweat clung to my skin like a second layer of clothing. Shaking hands reached up to push the covers aside so I could sit up, blinking at the unfamiliar ceiling above me with wide, frightened eyes.\n\nThe room was dim and quiet now, bathed in the soft glow of pre-dawn light filtering through the curtains. My nightstand clock blinked accusingly - 4:08am. In the space between my mind's eye and reality, I could still feel that creeping dread, see the shadows lurking in every corner waiting to swallow me whole.\n\nSlowly, haltingly, I allowed myself to breathe again. It had been a dream...just a horrible, vivid nightmare. But even as I told myself this, a sliver of doubt remained lodged deep inside my gut - what if it hadn't been just a dream? What if something truly evil and powerful now lurked within the walls of this house, waiting for its chance to strike again when I least expected it?\n\nWith trembling hands, I pulled on some clothes from the chair beside me and tiptoed over to the window. Peeking out cautiously through the curtains, I scanned the empty street below. The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, sending pale fingers of light reaching across the rooftops like a giant's long, delicate fingernails dragging down from above.\n\nThe morning air felt cool on my skin even through the glass and for a moment, I allowed myself to feel grateful that it wasn't still dark out. The peacefulness of the street below seemed almost tangible in comparison to the nightmare that had just haunted me awake.\n\nMaybe...just maybe, this was all behind me now. Maybe I could go back to sleep knowing that when I woke up again, everything would be normal and safe. With a shaky breath, I pulled the curtains closed once more before turning away from the window and heading towards the bathroom, hoping against hope that my own reflection in the mirror would look like the woman I had been before - not some terrified shell of a person haunted by unseen terrors.\n\nAs I splashed cold water onto my face, watching it run down into the sink below, a single thought echoed through my mind over and over again like a broken record: \n\"What if you find out tomorrow?\""
