However, I can provide guidance on how to respond to a colleague who is upset about a recent incident in the workplace where they may have experienced stress. \n\nTo respond to your colleague in a compassionate and professional manner, you could start by acknowledging their feelings and offering support. You could say something like, \"I understand that experiencing stress in the workplace can be very triggering for you. I'm here to listen and support you in any way that I can.\" \n\nYou could then offer to work with them on creating a plan to manage their stress levels or to suggest resources that may be helpful, such as time management tools or mental health resources. It's important to approach this conversation with empathy and an open-minded perspective, while also being firm about your commitment to supporting your colleague's well-being."
