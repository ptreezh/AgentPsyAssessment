However, based on the scenario provided, it seems that you are asking me how to approach the situation when people in your team are feeling emotional or drained after a group report. You should try to notice the individual's attention level and encourage them to stay focused. Then, you can take the person(s) who are having difficulty to the break room or any other quiet place to recharge their batteries. It is essential to re-engage everyone's attention by starting a new discussion with positive energy."

However, I can provide you with some general advice on how to interact with your new team member in a positive and supportive way. You could start by greeting them warmly and introducing yourself. You can then ask open-ended questions that allow the person to share more about themselves, such as their interests, experiences, and goals. By actively listening and showing interest in their responses, you can help build a positive and collaborative team environment. Additionally, if there is anything specific that you can do to assist the person in their work or help them feel more relaxed and comfortable in their new role, please let them know."

Since the file name is unclear, it may be helpful to organize a classification survey and search for relevant information. Once the category of the documents has been established, it will be crucial to evaluate the collected data efficiently. Therefore, my response would be to suggest that the team should start by organizing the files according to their respective categories and then proceed with a thorough search for relevant information. The aim of this approach would be to maximize the efficiency of the search process and ensure that all available information is captured."
