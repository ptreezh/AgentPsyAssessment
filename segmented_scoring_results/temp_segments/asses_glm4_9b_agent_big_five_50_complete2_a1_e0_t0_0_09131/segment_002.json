      "extracted_response": "In the meeting or immediately following it, I would handle the situation with the utmost professionalism and consideration for our team dynamics. My actions would be as follows:\n\n1. **Observe and Assess:** First, I would observe the colleague's behavior to determine if it seemed like a moment of frustration or a deeper issue.\n\n2. **Maintain Neutrality:** If appropriate, I would offer a neutral comment that acknowledges the difficulty of the situation without taking sides. For example, \"It seems like we're all dealing with some challenging feedback today.\"\n\n3. **Private Conversation:** After the meeting, I would approach my colleague privately and ask if they would like to discuss the matter further. This is done to respect their confidentiality and provide a safe space for expression.\n\n4. **Active Listening:** During this private conversation, I would practice active listening, allowing them to express their feelings without interruption. It's important that they feel heard and understood.\n\n5. **Fact-Finding:** If necessary, I might inquire about specific points of criticism to gain a better understanding of the issue. However, I would ensure that my questions are neutral and not accusatory.\n\n6. **Offer Support:** If appropriate, I would offer support or resources that could help them improve their future work. This might include additional training opportunities or access to expert consultation.\n\n7. **Reiterate Team Values:** I would remind them of the team's values and the importance of collaborative problem-solving, emphasizing that disagreements are a normal part of the creative process.\n\n8. **Follow-Up:** If the situation does not resolve itself promptly, I would follow up with my colleague to check on their well-being and progress. This shows that I am concerned about their well-being beyond just the immediate work issue.\n\nThroughout this process, I would adhere strictly to our company's codes of conduct and confidentiality policies, maintaining a professional demeanor and ensuring that all actions are focused on supporting the同事's development and the overall success of the team."
