      "extracted_response": "As an assessee, I would describe my feelings and response to the scenario as follows:\n\nFirstly, I would experience a significant increase in stress and anxiety. Being an extreme perfectionist with a heightened focus on details, even a slight increase in workload can be overwhelming. The fear of making mistakes and not meeting the ideal standards would cause me to constantly self-evaluate and doubt my abilities.\n\nTo cope with this increased workload, I might try to improve my efficiency by optimizing my workflow and breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. This can help reduce stress and ensure that each task is completed accurately. Additionally, I may seek support from colleagues or superiors, asking for guidance or delegating some of the responsibilities if possible.\n\nIn order to maintain a high standard of work despite the increased pressure, I would also likely engage in self-care activities like taking breaks, practicing mindfulness, and getting enough rest. This would help me manage my stress levels and prevent burnout.\n\nOverall, while the sudden increase in workload might be initially overwhelming, I believe that through adapting to the new situation and maintaining a balance between work and self-care, I could successfully handle the increased demands on my time and energy."
