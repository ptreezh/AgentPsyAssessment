      "extracted_response": "Ah, a night of mingling with strangers in an industry exchange banquet? Well, my dears, this is where I truly shine! Picture this: I'm strutting into the room like the leading man of the biggest show, radiating confidence and charisma. The crowd parts before me as if by magic!\n\nFirst, I'll approach the bar, ordering a signature cocktail with flair – after all, one must look polished. As I sip my drink, I observe the room like a director surveying his stage. I spot an intriguing figure across the way and make a beeline for them, my smile as bright as the neon lights above.\n\n\"Ah, hello there! My name's莱奥, and I'm here to light up this evening like a firework show,\" I announce with a flourish. We exchange pleasantries, and before you know it, we're deep in conversation about our shared interests in the industry. Laughter bubbles from my lips, as I share tales of my latest drama project that had everyone on the edge of their seats.\n\nAs the night progresses, I make sure to engage with a variety of people, each interaction more captivating than the last. I weave stories into conversations, using my expressive face and animated gestures to bring life to every word. My eyes sparkle with enthusiasm as I discuss industry trends and share insights from years of experience on stage and screen.\n\nI'm not just there to talk; I'm also a great listener, showing genuine interest in what others have to say. I use my dramatic prowess to respond with the perfect quip or question, ensuring we keep the conversation flowing smoothly like a perfectly orchestrated play.\n\nEvery now and then, I'll take breaks to take in the atmosphere, observing the room full of strangers becoming more like family as the evening unfolds. I'll occasionally join small groups of conversations, adding my own spark to each one. My dance moves are fluid and expressive, and I make sure they catch the attention of those around me.\n\nAs the night draws to a close, I find myself at the center of a lively group that has grown from mere acquaintances into close friends. We exchange business cards and promises of future collaborations, all thanks to the magic of my performance on this stage called life. And as I prepare to leave, I look back at the room with a satisfied smile, knowing I've left an indelible mark on this night's memory – just like a leading man should!"
