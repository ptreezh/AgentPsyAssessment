I would take into account any constructive criticism and use it to improve the logo design.\n\nFinally, once we have a design that reflects our values, represents our team, and stands out from other logos, I would ensure that all necessary elements are included in the file, such as different formats (e.g., vector, raster) and colors. The team can then use this logo for our upcoming project with confidence."
