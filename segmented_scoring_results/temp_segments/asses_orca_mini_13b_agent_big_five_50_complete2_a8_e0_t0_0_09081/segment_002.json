      "extracted_response": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the ability of computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves training algorithms on large datasets, which allows them to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on new information.\n\nIn simple terms, machine learning enables computers to automatically improve their performance at a task by learning from data and experience. This technology has a wide range of applications in various fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. For example, when you use a recommendation system like Netflix or Spotify, it is using machine learning algorithms to analyze your preferences and suggest movies or music that you might enjoy.\n\nIn summary, Machine Learning allows computers to learn from data and experience, improving their performance at a given task without being explicitly programmed to do so."
