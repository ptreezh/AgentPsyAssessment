I would encourage each individual to express their ideas openly and share their thoughts on what makes a logo truly distinctive.\n\nInstead of directly giving answers or imposing my own opinions, I would ask questions that challenge the team's assumptions and prompt them to think deeper about the project. For example:\n\n- What is the essence of our team's values and mission? How can we reflect this in the logo?\n- Are there any symbols or icons that hold special meaning for each member of the team, which could be integrated into the design?\n- Is it more important to create a unique logo or one that resonates with our target audience? How can we balance these two objectives?\n\nBy guiding the team members through this process, I aim to help them discover their own answers and come up with an original and meaningful logo that truly represents the essence of the team."
