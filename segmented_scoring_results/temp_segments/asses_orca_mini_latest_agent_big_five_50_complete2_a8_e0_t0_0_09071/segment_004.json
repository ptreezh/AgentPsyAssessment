It is important to note that some people may have been affected by the excitement and may need a refresher on attention and focus.\n\nTo help with the task of sharing information, I would suggest a systematic and organized way of presenting the information to everyone. This can be done through group discussions or individual presentations, depending on the size of the team and the complexity of the topic being discussed. It is important to keep the audience engaged and maintain eye contact to build trust and establish rapport."

One approach would be to listen actively and show interest in their thoughts and feelings. You could ask open-ended questions that allow the team member to share their thoughts and feelings without feeling judged. For example, you could ask:\n\n\"What brings you here today? Do you feel nervous or excited about joining our team?\" or \"Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and what you're looking forward to in this new role?\"\n\nBy actively listening and asking questions, you can help the team member feel more comfortable and accepted. Additionally, you can ask follow-up questions to gain a deeper understanding of their perspective and share your own insights to build rapport."
