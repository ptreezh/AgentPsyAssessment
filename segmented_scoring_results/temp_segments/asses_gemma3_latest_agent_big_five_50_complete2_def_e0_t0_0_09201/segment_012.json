I’d feel a huge surge of relief, excitement, and probably a bit of pride. I’d be buzzing with energy, feeling optimistic and motivated.\n\nHowever, immediately following that, hearing about the setback with another project would have completely knocked me sideways. It would have shifted my mood almost instantly. I’d likely feel a wave of disappointment, frustration, and maybe even a bit of self-doubt. There would be a definite contrast – from intense positive energy to a heavy feeling of discouragement. It would be a jarring experience, and I’d probably feel a significant drop in my mood, potentially leading to some anxiety or worry about the overall situation. I'd be trying to process both the success and the failure, and it would be a difficult balance to manage."
