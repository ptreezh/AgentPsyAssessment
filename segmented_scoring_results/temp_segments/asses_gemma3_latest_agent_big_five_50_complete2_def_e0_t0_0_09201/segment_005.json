      "extracted_response": "Okay, here’s my explanation:\n\n“Imagine you’re teaching a dog a trick, right? You show it what you want it to do, and if it does it right, you give it a treat. If it does it wrong, you gently correct it. The dog learns by *seeing* what you want, and by getting rewarded for doing it correctly.\n\nMachine learning is kind of similar, but instead of a dog, it’s a computer. We feed the computer *lots* of examples – maybe thousands or even millions of pictures of cats. The computer looks at these pictures and tries to find patterns. It’s like it’s learning what a ‘cat’ looks like – pointy ears, whiskers, a certain shape. \n\nIt doesn’t know what a cat *is* in a human way. It just keeps looking for patterns in the data – the pictures.  The more pictures it sees, the better it gets at recognizing cats.  It’s learning from experience, just like the dog. \n\nBasically, we’re teaching a computer to learn from data, without us explicitly telling it *how* to do it. It’s finding patterns and making predictions based on those patterns. It’s like a very, very complex, self-teaching process.\""
