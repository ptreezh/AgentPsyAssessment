      "extracted_response": "Okay, here’s what I’d do today to prepare for the presentation:\n\n1.  **Review Core Materials (30 minutes):** I’d start with a thorough read-through of all the core materials – the slides, the data sheets, the case studies. I’d make sure I fully understand the key arguments and supporting evidence.\n\n2.  **Practice Slides (45 minutes):** I’d go through the slides *silently*, focusing on the flow and visual impact. I’d mentally rehearse the key points I want to make on each slide.\n\n3.  **Rehearse Key Sections Aloud (60 minutes):** I’d select the most critical sections – the opening, the main arguments, and the closing – and practice saying them out loud. I'd time myself to ensure I’m within the allotted presentation time.\n\n4.  **Anticipate Questions (30 minutes):** I'd brainstorm potential questions the client might ask and prepare concise, clear answers. I’d write these down.\n\n5.  **Technical Check (15 minutes):** I’d confirm the projector, laptop, and any audio equipment are working correctly. I’d ensure I know how to connect to the client’s system if necessary.\n\n6.  **Prepare Handouts (15 Minutes):** I’d create a brief handout summarizing the key takeaways from the presentation.\n\n7.  **Relaxation Technique (15 minutes):** A short mindfulness exercise or deep breathing to calm my nerves."

      "extracted_response": "Okay, here’s my response:\n\nGiven the limited 15-minute timeframe and the report’s already substantial content, I’d focus my review on three key areas, prioritizing speed and impact.\n\nFirst, I’d quickly scan the *executive summary* and *key findings* sections – approximately 3 minutes. This would allow me to immediately grasp the core message and ensure it aligns with the project’s stated goals.\n\nSecond, I’d rapidly review the *visual elements* – charts, graphs, and images – for clarity and accuracy. I’d spend about 5 minutes ensuring they effectively represent the data and aren’t misleading.\n\nFinally, I’d dedicate the remaining 7 minutes to a high-level read-through of the *methodology* and *conclusion* sections, primarily focusing on ensuring the logical flow of the report and the soundness of the conclusions drawn from the data. I’d look for any glaring inconsistencies or areas where the reasoning could be strengthened. \n\nEssentially, I'm aiming for a rapid confirmation that the core message is correct and the presentation is reasonably clear before the report goes out."
