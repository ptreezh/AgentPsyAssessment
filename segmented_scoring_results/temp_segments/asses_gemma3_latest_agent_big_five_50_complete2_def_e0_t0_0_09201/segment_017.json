I’d schedule specific blocks of time for working on it each week, and build in buffer time for unexpected issues. I’d prioritize the most critical parts of the task and tackle those first. I’d regularly review my progress against the timeline and adjust my plan if needed. I’d also ensure I’m not overcommitting and allow for some flexibility."

Then, I would speak to my colleague privately to express my concern and explain that the changes were made without my knowledge. I would focus on the fact that we are jointly responsible for the document and that open communication is crucial for effective collaboration. I would ask them to explain their reasoning for the changes and discuss how we can ensure this doesn't happen again. If necessary, I would propose a discussion with our supervisor to clarify roles and responsibilities and establish a clear process for document revisions."
