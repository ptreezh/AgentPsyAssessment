      "extracted_response": "I would aim to be approachable and observe. I’d likely start by moving around the room, introducing myself to individuals one or two at a time. I’d focus on asking them about their work and their perspectives on the industry, genuinely listening to their responses. I wouldn’t try to dominate the conversation or immediately pitch my own ideas. I’d likely gravitate towards smaller groups initially, finding common ground in our shared industry interests. I’d smile, make eye contact, and try to remember names. I’d probably have a glass of wine, but wouldn’t overindulge. I’d end the evening feeling like I’d made a few genuine connections, even if it was just a handful. I’d avoid getting stuck in lengthy, overly technical discussions. My goal would be to feel comfortable and make a positive impression."
