I know it can be a little overwhelming on your first day, so please don’t hesitate to ask any questions, no matter how small they seem. We’re all here to help you get settled in.” I’d then offer to show them around briefly, perhaps point out key resources or introduce them to a few team members. I'd try to create a relaxed atmosphere by keeping the initial conversation light and friendly."

I’d start by documenting the specific issues – exactly how disorganized are the files, what categories (if any) are being used, and how this disorganization is impacting my workflow and the team’s. Then, I’d propose a collaborative solution. I’d suggest a team meeting to discuss a standardized naming convention and a clear folder structure. I’d volunteer to take the lead on creating this system and training the team on its use. My actions would prioritize efficiency and consistency, aiming for a system that’s easy to maintain and readily accessible for everyone."
