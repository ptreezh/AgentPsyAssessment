      "extracted_response": "I would feel a rising sense of frustration and irritation. The persistent tapping would be distracting and disruptive to my concentration, making it difficult to fully focus on my work. I’d likely start feeling increasingly tense and my productivity would suffer.\n\nMy initial action would be to subtly try to ignore it, attempting to refocus my attention on my task. If that didn’t work after a short while, I would then politely and quietly ask the colleague to stop, explaining that the noise is distracting me. I’d aim for a neutral and non-accusatory tone."

      "extracted_response": "My initial reaction would be a mixture of cautious interest and slight apprehension. I’d likely feel a need to quickly assess the credibility of the model and its potential relevance to my work. I’d probably offer a polite, encouraging nod and say something like, “That’s certainly an interesting approach. Could you elaborate a little on the key assumptions underpinning it?”\n\nI’d then immediately start formulating questions, likely beginning with: “How does this model compare to the methods we currently use? What kind of data would it require to produce meaningful results? And most importantly, what’s the practical application – how could it actually benefit our work?” I’d also want to know if there were any established research supporting this model, and if not, what the level of uncertainty was."
