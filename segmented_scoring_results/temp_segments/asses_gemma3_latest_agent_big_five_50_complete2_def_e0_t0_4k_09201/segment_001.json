I was just thinking – it’s easy to get a little quiet when we’re not face-to-face. Maybe we could start with something simple? Like, everyone could quickly share one thing they’ve been working on recently, either work-related or just something interesting they’ve been up to. No need to go into huge detail, just a quick one-sentence update. I’ll start – I’ve been trying out a new sourdough recipe, and it’s been a bit of a challenge, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it!” \n\n(Pause, smile, and look encouragingly at the group.)"

The prospect of working with a completely new team, with different backgrounds, is stimulating – it presents a significant learning opportunity and the potential for fresh perspectives. However, I also anticipate challenges. Successfully navigating a new team dynamic, especially over a month-long period, requires strong communication skills and a willingness to adapt. I’ll be focusing on establishing rapport quickly and proactively seeking to understand the team’s working styles and priorities. It feels like a good test of my collaborative abilities and adaptability."
