      "extracted_response": "I would feel a significant surge of anxiety and stress. It’s overwhelming to suddenly face twice the workload. Initially, I’d likely feel a sense of panic – a feeling of being completely outpaced and potentially failing to meet expectations. I’d probably experience increased heart rate, difficulty concentrating, and a general feeling of being on edge.\n\nMy immediate response would be to try and understand *why* the workload has increased. I’d need to talk to my supervisor to clarify the reasons and priorities. I’d then carefully assess my current tasks and deadlines, realistically evaluating what I could achieve and what needed to be pushed back. I’d prioritize ruthlessly, focusing on the most critical items first. I’d also communicate openly with my supervisor about my concerns and potential challenges, proposing solutions if possible – perhaps suggesting temporary assistance or adjusting timelines. I’d be focused on maintaining a calm, organized approach to manage the situation effectively."

      "extracted_response": "I would start by asking for a detailed brief about the project – the company’s values, target audience, the project’s goals, and any existing brand guidelines. I’d want to understand the overall feeling and message we’re trying to convey. Then, I’d brainstorm a wide range of initial concepts, sketching quickly and exploring different styles – from minimalist to more complex. I’d focus on generating a large quantity of ideas initially, without immediately judging them. After that, I’d narrow down the options based on the brief and team feedback, iterating on the strongest concepts, exploring color palettes and typography, and continually refining the design. I’d actively seek feedback throughout the process, being open to suggestions and willing to adapt my approach."
