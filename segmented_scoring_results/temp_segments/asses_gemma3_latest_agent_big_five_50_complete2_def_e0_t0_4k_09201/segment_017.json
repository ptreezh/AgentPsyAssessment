First, I’d estimate the total time required, then divide that into monthly, weekly, and daily targets. I’d prioritize the milestones based on dependencies – what needs to happen before others can begin. I’d schedule specific blocks of time in my calendar dedicated solely to this task, treating them like important appointments. I’d also build in regular review points – perhaps weekly – to assess progress and adjust the plan if necessary. Finally, I’d identify potential roadblocks and proactively develop contingency plans."

My priority would be to understand their perspective and collaboratively discuss how to rectify the situation, focusing on achieving the original intent of the document while correcting the errors."
