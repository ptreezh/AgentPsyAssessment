During the meeting, I would make eye contact with the colleague and, if appropriate, offer a quiet, supportive comment like, “That was a tough critique, David. I’m here if you want to talk about it.” After the meeting, I’d check in with him privately. I’d say something like, “I noticed you seemed a little quiet during the meeting, David. I wanted to see if you were okay. It’s understandable to feel down after a critical discussion.” I’d genuinely listen to his response and offer a sympathetic ear."
