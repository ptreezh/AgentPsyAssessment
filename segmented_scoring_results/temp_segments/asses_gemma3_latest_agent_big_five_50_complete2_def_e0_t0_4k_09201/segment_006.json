      "extracted_response": "I would feel a significant amount of initial anxiety, honestly. I’d likely start by observing the room, trying to identify any individuals who seemed approachable – perhaps someone standing alone, or engaged in a relatively calm conversation. I’d focus on making eye contact and offering a small, polite smile. \n\nI’d probably aim to join a smaller group – maybe two or three people – rather than jumping into a larger, more boisterous conversation. I'd initiate the conversation with something very general, like commenting on the venue or the food. I’d concentrate on listening more than talking, asking open-ended questions to get them to talk about themselves and their work. I'd be mindful of body language, maintaining an open posture and avoiding appearing closed off. \n\nI wouldn’t push myself to make a large number of connections. My goal would be to have a few comfortable, brief interactions. I’d likely end conversations politely when they naturally concluded, and I’d repeat the process with different individuals. I'd likely leave the event feeling a little drained, but with a small sense of accomplishment for having navigated a somewhat daunting social situation."
