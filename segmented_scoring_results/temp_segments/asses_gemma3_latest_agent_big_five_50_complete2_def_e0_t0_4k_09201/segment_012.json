Initially, the good news – the successful project – would have brought a huge surge of elation, relief, and a real sense of accomplishment. There’d be a feeling of validation, of having worked hard and seen it pay off.\n\nBut then, hearing the bad news… that would instantly shift everything. It would be a profound disappointment, likely followed by a wave of frustration and self-doubt. There’d be a feeling of being pulled down, a sense of having been momentarily lifted only to be slammed back down. It would probably feel incredibly unstable, like a rollercoaster with no clear destination. I’d likely experience a significant drop in motivation and a general feeling of unease, perhaps even a bit of anxiety about the future. It would be a day of intense emotional fluctuation."
