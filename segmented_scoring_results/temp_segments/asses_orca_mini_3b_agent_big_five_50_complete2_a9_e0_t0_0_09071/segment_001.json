However, starting the activity may have some initial tensions, and everyone seems to be hesitant to speak up. \n\nAs an AI agent, I suggest you take the following steps to actively participate in the event:\n\n1. Listen and observe the situation: Take a few deep breaths, and approach the situation with an open mind. It might be helpful to reflect on your own experiences and perspectives before speaking up.\n\n2. Share your thoughts and ideas: Once you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts and ideas, speak up and participate in the conversation. Try to engage others by asking questions or responding to their comments.\n\n3. Build relationships: Participating in team activities can help you build relationships with other team members. By actively engaging in discussions and conversations, you can strengthen your connections with those around you.\n\n4. Be authentic: Remember that everyone is unique and has their own perspectives and experiences. Avoid trying to fit into a particular mold or stereotype, and be yourself.\n\nBy following these steps, you can actively participate in the event and contribute to building positive relationships within the team."
