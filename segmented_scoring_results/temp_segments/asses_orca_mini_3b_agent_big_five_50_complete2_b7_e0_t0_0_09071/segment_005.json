You could try to communicate with the person calmly and gently, and ask them if they are okay and if there is anything you can do to help. You can also offer to talk to them about their concerns or suggest resources that might be helpful for them. It's important to remain empathetic and non-judgmental in this type of situation."

The discussion is quite abstract and theoretical in nature, and raises some interesting questions about the nature of human existence and the role of philosophy in shaping our thoughts and beliefs."
