By identifying pain points and areas of opportunities, we can design new features that are aligned with users' needs and preferences. Additionally, conducting surveys and focus groups could help us gather more insights about how users currently use the product and what they would like to see in a new version. By thoroughly understanding our target audience, we can create a more engaging and user-friendly experience that attracts and retains users."
