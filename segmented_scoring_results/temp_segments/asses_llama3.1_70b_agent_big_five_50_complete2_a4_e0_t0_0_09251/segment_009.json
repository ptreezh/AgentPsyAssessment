      "extracted_response": "I can totally understand how they'd feel on their first day! I'd immediately give them a warm smile and extend my hand for a friendly handshake or a gentle pat on the back, saying something like:\n\n\"Hey there, welcome to our team! I'm David, but please call me Dave. We're super excited to have you on board! I can tell you might be feeling a bit nervous, but don't worry, we're all pretty laid-back here. Why don't I show you around and introduce you to everyone? We'll get you settled in no time.\"\n\nI'd then take the time to give them a tour of our workspace, introducing them to each team member and explaining what they do. Along the way, I'd ask open-ended questions like \"What made you decide to join our team?\" or \"What are you looking forward to working on?\" to help break the ice and get a sense of their interests.\n\nTo make them feel more at ease, I might also share a lighthearted story about my own first day jitters or a funny anecdote about one of our team members. By doing so, I hope to create a relaxed atmosphere where they can start feeling comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas with us.\n\nThroughout the conversation, I'd maintain eye contact, use positive body language, and listen actively to what they have to say. If they seem hesitant or unsure about anything, I'd reassure them that it's completely normal and offer assistance in any way I can. My goal is to make our new team member feel valued, supported, and excited to be part of our community!"
