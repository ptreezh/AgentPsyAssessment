You can ask them questions like \"What do you think has been bothering you lately?\", or \"Do you feel overwhelmed by the workload?\"\n\nSecondly, you could try to provide some solutions or suggestions that would help to alleviate their stress. For example, if they are feeling overwhelmed, you could suggest taking a break or delegating tasks to other team members. If they are struggling with a particular task, you could offer to assist them or provide resources that can help them better understand the topic at hand.\n\nThirdly, it would be important for you to recognize when your colleagues are becoming fatigued and start to take proactive steps to boost their attention and motivation. You can encourage them to take breaks, acknowledge their contributions, and offer support and guidance when needed."
