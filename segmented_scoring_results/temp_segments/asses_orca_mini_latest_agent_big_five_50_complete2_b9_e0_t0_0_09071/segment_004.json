As I deliver each section of the report, I would make sure to keep a close eye on my audience's attention level and note their engagement.\n\nBased on this assessment, I would think carefully about how best to proceed with my portion of the report.

Be friendly and approachable: Start off by greeting your colleague and introducing yourself. Make eye contact and use a smile to help build rapport.\n\n2. Listen actively: Ask questions to understand your colleague's perspective and what they are going through. Use open-ended questions such as \"What do you think about...?\" or \"How do you feel about...?\"\n\n3. Offer support: If your colleague is feeling stressed or overwhelmed, offer to help them manage their workload or provide resources to aid in their task completion.\n\n4. Encourage self-care: Suggest activities such as exercise, meditation, or other self-care practices that can help your colleague de-stress and stay focused.\n\n5. Provide constructive feedback: If necessary, offer constructive criticism to help your colleague improve their work. Use positive language and provide specific examples to show how their actions can be improved.\n\nRemember, the key to effective communication is active listening, empathy, and a willingness to collaborate with others to help them feel supported and fulfilled in their roles."

This could be due to the lack of organization or proper classification of the files.
