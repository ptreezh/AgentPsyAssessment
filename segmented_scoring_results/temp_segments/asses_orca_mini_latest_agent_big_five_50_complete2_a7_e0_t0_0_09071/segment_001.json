The user may benefit from seeking external support as they struggle with coping with their current situation. It is recommended to prioritize self-care and engage in activities that promote relaxation and well-being. Additionally, it may be helpful for the user to reflect on their goals and values in order to better understand what they want to achieve amidst this difficult period."
