I would encourage everyone to take a moment to gather their thoughts and approach the remaining portion of the discussion with renewed focus and energy. I would then proceed to share the information I have with the group, ensuring that I communicate it in a clear and concise manner. By doing so, I will be able to help rekindle the team's attention and drive their attention to the task at hand."

This could include providing emotional support, setting realistic expectations, giving constructive feedback, and showing interest in their well-being. Additionally, I can suggest that you communicate with your team leader or supervisor to ensure that they are aware of any concerns or issues that arise during the integration process."
