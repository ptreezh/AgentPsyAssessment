If there are no opportunities to engage in meaningful conversation, I would focus on enjoying the music and people-watching. My primary goal would be to respect others' enjoyment of the party while avoiding distractions from my own work tasks. If someone asks about my profession or an aspect of my work, such as my role as a mechanical engineer, I would be open to discussing it. However, if the conversation is too abstract and theoretical, I might politely excuse myself to continue focusing on enjoying the party."
