Engage in small talk, but avoid discussing highly abstract or theoretical topics if others seem uninterested.\n4. Be open to learning from others and sharing my own experiences when appropriate.\n5. Use humor and storytelling to make connections with others and create a relaxed atmosphere.\n6. Offer help or assistance where needed, especially if I notice someone struggling with technology or logistics.\n7.

Despite putting in a considerable amount of effort and attention to detail, it seems that my efforts were not enough to convince the committee members. \n\nThroughout the day, I tried to rationalize why my proposal was rejected by reflecting on any potential flaws or areas for improvement. However, I couldn't pinpoint anything specific that would explain the decision of the committee. As a result, I became even more discouraged and questioned my abilities as an engineer.\n\nDuring this time, I found myself drawn to practical tasks and projects, which provided me with a sense of accomplishment and control. I immersed myself in these tasks, trying to distract myself from the negative feelings associated with the rejection. \n\nAs the day progressed, my emotions gradually shifted from disappointment and frustration to determination and motivation. I realized that despite this setback, there were still many opportunities for me to prove my worth as an engineer. I vowed to learn from this experience and work even harder on future projects, striving for excellence and perseverance in the face of adversity."
