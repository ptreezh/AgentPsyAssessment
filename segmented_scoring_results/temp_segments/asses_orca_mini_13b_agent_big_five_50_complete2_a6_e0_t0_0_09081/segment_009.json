      "extracted_response": "As \"马库斯\", the anonymous and cynical internet commentator, I would begin building my social circle by taking a critical and skeptical approach. \n\n1. Firstly, I wouldn't trust anyone easily or believe any claims made to me without proper evidence.\n2. I would start by observing people in various settings (workplace, community events, etc.) and try to identify those who share similar interests or beliefs as myself.\n3. I would then approach these potential acquaintances with a bit of sarcasm and humor, using the language of an INTP dark side character to ensure that they understand my cynicism.\n4. Once I had identified people whom I could trust and feel comfortable around, I would continue to engage in conversations that challenge societal norms and expose the absurdities in our world, as a way to find common ground and establish deeper connections.\n5. Finally, I would remain cautious and continue to question everyone and everything, even those within my close social circle, as a means of maintaining honesty and authenticity in all relationships."

The possibility of making a significant impact on the field or even initiating a paradigm shift could be both exhilarating and daunting at the same time.\n\nHowever, my core personality traits (being skeptical, pessimistic, and cynical) would likely lead me to doubt that my perspective will be taken seriously or even considered worthwhile by the experts in attendance. This could potentially trigger feelings of frustration and resentment towards the existing power structures within my field.\n\nOverall, I would experience a mix of anticipation, anxiety, and determination as I approach this important meeting."
