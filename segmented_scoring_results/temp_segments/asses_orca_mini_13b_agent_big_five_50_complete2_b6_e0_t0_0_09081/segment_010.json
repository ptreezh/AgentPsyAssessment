Once this is done, I would present the initial ideas to the team for feedback and refinement. \n\nOnce the general direction of the logo design is agreed upon by the team, I would use professional design software to create digital mockups of the proposed logo. These designs would then be presented to the team again for further feedback and refinements. \n\nUpon finalizing the design, I would ensure that it is visually appealing, easily adaptable to various mediums like websites, business cards, etc., and reflective of our team's values and mission statement. Finally, the logo will be shared with the wider audience and implemented across all relevant branding materials.\n\nIn conclusion, I would actively participate in the design process by gathering inputs from my team members, researching industry standards, creating initial designs, refining based on feedback, and ensuring the final product is visually appealing, adaptable, and reflective of our values."
