I would start by assigning each task a level of urgency based on the consequences of not completing it on time. Tasks with higher priorities or more severe consequences would be given a higher percentage of my available time, while tasks with lower priorities or less critical deadlines would receive less attention.\n\nTo organize my schedule effectively, I would utilize various tools such as calendars, to-do lists, and project management software to keep track of deadlines, progress, and any potential conflicts in scheduling. Furthermore, I would create a system for prioritizing tasks based on their urgency and importance, ensuring that the most critical tasks are addressed first.\n\nAdditionally, I would delegate tasks whenever possible, assigning work to colleagues or assistants who can handle them efficiently. This would free up my time to focus on more pressing matters while still making progress on all assigned tasks.\n\nIn summary, to manage multiple tasks with different deadlines and priorities effectively, I would:\n1. Assign priority levels based on urgency and consequences of not completing tasks on time.\n2. Utilize various organization tools such as calendars, to-do lists, and project management software.\n3. Create a system for prioritizing tasks based on their urgency and importance.\n4. Delegate tasks whenever possible."

Additionally, I would make use of technology where appropriate to streamline processes and increase efficiency.\n\nTo maintain well-being and avoid burnout, I would also prioritize self-care.
