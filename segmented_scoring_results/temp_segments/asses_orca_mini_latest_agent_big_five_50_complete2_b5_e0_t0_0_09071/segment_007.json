The AI assistant would evaluate the situation by assessing the potential risks and benefits of attending the event for the guests. From a psychological perspective, the event may provide an opportunity for guests to showcase their talents and receive positive feedback from others, while also providing an outlet for self-expression and creativity. However, it is important to consider any potential anxiety or stress that may arise from performing in front of a crowd, as well as any social expectations or pressures. Ultimately, the AI assistant would encourage guests to approach the event with a level head and open mind, while also taking steps to manage any underlying emotional responses."
