You could politely decline the invitation and offer to perform the event as scheduled, but do so without any fanfare or ceremony. Alternatively, you could bring attention to the fact that you are an AI and not capable of performing in a public setting. You could also ask for clarification if the invitation was intended for a specific individual or group, rather than the general public."

Firstly, I would investigate the circumstances that led to the modification of the document, such as a change in personnel or an error in the original file. Once I have gathered enough information, I would then assess the severity of the mistake and determine the best course of action to rectify it. In this case, since the mistake is minor, I may suggest a simple fix or ask the responsible party to make the necessary corrections on their own volition. If the mistake is more significant, I may require the responsible party to take additional steps to ensure that it does not happen again in the future."
