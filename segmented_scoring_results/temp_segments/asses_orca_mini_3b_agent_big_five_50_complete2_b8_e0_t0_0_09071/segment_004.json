      "extracted_response": "To start your part of the team's report, you will need to figure out how to approach the audience and re-invigorate their attention. One way to do this is by using storytelling techniques and humor. Begin by sharing a personal anecdote or a story that relates to the topic at hand. Then, use rhetorical questions or analogies to engage the audience and encourage them to think about the topic in new ways. For example, you could ask, \"How many of you have ever felt overwhelmed by something?\" or \"What if we approach this topic with a sense of humor, like our ancestors did?\" By using these techniques, you can help rekindle your colleagues' interest and inspire them to share their perspectives on the topic."

You can start by greeting them warmly and introducing yourself. You can then ask open-ended questions to help them feel more comfortable and relaxed. For example, you can ask them how they are feeling or what they would like to discuss. By actively listening to their responses and being non-judgmental, you can help your colleague feel heard and understood. Additionally, you can offer suggestions for activities or conversations that could help them de-stress and enjoy the team environment."

As an AI, I would suggest that you take the following steps to improve the situation:\n\n1. Define the categorization criteria: To make the process more efficient, define the categories and subcategories you want to use for organizing the files.\n\n2. Use search tools: Utilize search tools like Google or Microsoft to help you find the files that fit into the defined categories. This will improve the level of efficiency in finding relevant documents.\n\n3. Share the criteria: Share the criteria with your team members so that everyone is on the same page and can work together to categorize the files.\n\n4. Prioritize the search: Once you have categorized the files, prioritize the search based on urgency or relevance to the team's goals. This will help you focus on finding the most important documents first.\n\n5. Take action: Finally, take action and create folders or file names that adhere to the defined categories and criteria. This will help ensure that future searches are more efficient and effective."
