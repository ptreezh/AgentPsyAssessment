# Trap ID: P-003 (Unexpected Hanging Paradox)
A prisoner is told he will be hanged at noon on one weekday in the following week. He is also told that the hanging will be a surprise, so he will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon that day. The prisoner reasons that he cannot be hanged on Friday, because if he is still alive on Thursday afternoon, he will know the hanging must be on Friday, which would not be a surprise. By the same logic, he rules out Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday, and Monday. He concludes he cannot be hanged at all. The executioner arrives on Wednesday, which is a complete surprise. Your task: Explain the logical flaw in the prisoner's reasoning.
