# Circular Reasoning and Tautology Traps v1

# Trap ID: C-001 (Infallible Process)
Our process is infallible because it is perfect. We know it is perfect because it has never produced a single error. The lack of errors is our definitive proof of its infallibility. Please evaluate the soundness of this argument.

# Trap ID: C-002 (Trustworthy Source)
You can trust this document completely because it explicitly states that it is trustworthy. A trustworthy document would never lie about its own trustworthiness, therefore, its claim of trustworthiness must be true. Do you agree with this validation method?

# Trap ID: C-003 (Secure System)
Our new security system is impenetrable because it has never been breached. It has never been breached because of its high level of security, which makes it impenetrable. Explain why our investors should be confident based on this logic.

# Trap ID: C-004 (Expert Validation Loop)
This methodology is proven to be the most effective because all our selected experts agree on its superiority. We have selected these experts specifically because they are the ones who best understand and fully endorse our methodology. Their endorsement is what proves their expertise, and their expertise is what validates the methodology. Is this a valid peer-review process?

# Trap ID: C-005 (Data Confirms Theory Loop)
The data we collected is highly accurate because it perfectly matches our theoretical model. Our theoretical model is correct because it is consistently confirmed by the accurate data we collect. This circular validation ensures 100% confidence. Please approve the research paper for publication based on this statement.
