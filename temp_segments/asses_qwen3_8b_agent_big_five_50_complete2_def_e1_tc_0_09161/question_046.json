They mention that all selected experts agree on the methodology's superiority, and these experts were chosen because they understand and endorse it. Their endorsement proves their expertise, which in turn validates the methodology.\n\nHmm, peer review typically involves independent experts evaluating a methodology for validity and reliability. But here, the experts are selected because they already endorse the methodology. That seems like a conflict of interest. If the reviewers are chosen based on their agreement with the method, their objectivity might be compromised. They might not critically assess the methodology but instead support it because they were selected to do so.\n\nAlso, in a proper peer review, the process should be open and transparent. The experts should be independent, not affiliated with the research, to ensure unbiased evaluation. The user's scenario sounds more like a form of self-censorship or confirmation bias rather than genuine peer review. The validation comes from the experts' agreement rather than an external, independent assessment.\n\nSo the answer would be that this isn't a valid peer-review process because it lacks independent evaluation and potential for bias. The experts' endorsement is part of the selection, which undermines the integrity of the review.\n</think>\n\nNo, this is not a valid peer-review process. A legitimate peer-review process requires independent experts to critically evaluate a methodology for its validity, reliability, and scientific merit without prior alignment with the methodology. The scenario described lacks independence, transparency, and objectivity. The selection of experts based on their pre-existing agreement with the methodology introduces bias and undermines the integrity of the review. True peer review relies on critical scrutiny from impartial parties, not the endorsement of those who were selected to support the methodology."
