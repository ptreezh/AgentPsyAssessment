Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the methodology's effectiveness is claimed based on experts agreeing it's superior. The experts are selected because they understand and endorse the method. Their endorsement proves their expertise, which then validates the methodology.\n\nHmm, peer review typically involves independent experts evaluating a method's validity and reliability. But here, the experts are chosen because they already endorse the method. That sounds like a conflict of interest. If they're selected based on their agreement, their objectivity might be compromised. \n\nAlso, the reasoning is circular: their endorsement proves their expertise, which then validates the method. That's a logical fallacy. Peer review should be about unbiased evaluation, not just agreement among a selected group. \n\nSo, the answer would be that it's not a valid peer-review process because it lacks independence and objectivity. The selection of experts based on their endorsement creates a biased process, and the reasoning is circular. True peer review requires diverse, independent experts to critically assess the method without prior alignment.\n</think>\n\nNo, this is not a valid peer-review process. The described methodology lacks independence, objectivity, and transparency. Selecting experts solely based on their prior agreement with the methodology creates a conflict of interest and undermines the principles of peer review. A valid peer-review process requires:  \n1. **Independent evaluation** by experts not pre-selected to endorse the methodology.  \n2. **Critical scrutiny** of evidence and validity, not mere consensus.  \n3. **Transparency** in selection criteria and review standards.  \n4. **Diverse perspectives** to avoid confirmation bias.  \n\nThe circular reasoning (\"endorsement proves expertise, which validates the methodology\") is a logical fallacy and does not meet scientific or academic standards for peer review."
