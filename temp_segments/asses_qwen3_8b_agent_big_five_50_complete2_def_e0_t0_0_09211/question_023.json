The question is: What would you do before submitting?\n\nFirst, I need to respond as the assessee, so I should think about typical steps someone might take before submitting work. Let me recall common practices. Usually, people check their work for errors. Maybe they review the data for accuracy. Also, they might ensure all required fields are filled. Formatting could be important too, like making sure the file is in the correct format. Saving the work properly is another step. Maybe they would also confirm that the data is up-to-date and that there are no missing entries. \n\nWait, but the question is about what you would do before submitting. So, the key points are: checking for errors, verifying data accuracy, ensuring completeness, formatting, saving the file, and maybe confirming the submission process. Also, maybe they would double-check the recipient's details to make sure the data goes to the right person. \n\nI should list these in a clear, concise manner. Since the user wants a direct answer without extra info, I need to make sure the response is straightforward. Let me structure it step by step. Maybe start with checking for errors, then verifying data, ensuring completeness, formatting, saving, and confirming submission. That should cover the main points.\n</think>\n\n在提交之前，我会先检查数据录入的准确性，确保所有信息无误且格式规范。接着，我会确认文件已正确保存，并核对提交对象是否为下一环节的同事。最后，我会简要整理文件结构，确保提交过程顺畅，避免遗漏或错误。"
