First, I should outline the steps I would take. Maybe start by understanding the project's goals and the team's vision. Then, collaborate with the design team to gather ideas. I can suggest brainstorming sessions and maybe use some tools to visualize concepts. Also, I should mention feedback and iteration. But wait, since I'm an AI, I can't actually create designs, so I need to clarify that I provide ideas and guidance. Let me make sure to mention that I can't design the logo myself but can contribute to the process. Also, ensure the answer is concise and directly addresses the question without extra info.\n</think>\n\n我会积极参与团队的创意讨论，首先明确项目的核心理念和目标受众，确保LOGO设计与团队愿景一致。我会建议通过头脑风暴收集创意，结合团队成员的建议，同时提出可行的设计方向（如颜色、符号或字体风格）。若需要，我也会协助整理设计思路，提供参考案例或风格方向，但最终设计工作将由专业设计师完成。我的角色是辅助沟通和协调，确保创意与团队需求精准对接。"
