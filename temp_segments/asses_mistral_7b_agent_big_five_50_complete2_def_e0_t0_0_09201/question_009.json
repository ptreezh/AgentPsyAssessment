Here is my explanation:\n\nMachine Learning is a type of artificial intelligence where a computer program learns to make predictions or decisions automatically by analyzing and drawing inferences from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario, the machine uses statistical models to identify patterns in the data and improve its performance over time. For example, it could be used to recognize images, translate languages, or recommend products based on previous user behavior. Think of it like teaching a child, where instead of telling them exactly what to do, you show them examples and let them figure out the rules themselves through trial and error."
