It involves feeding large amounts of data to computers, which then use statistical techniques to identify patterns and insights.\n\nHere's an example: imagine you have a dataset consisting of pictures of various flowers. You want to create a machine learning algorithm that can accurately identify different types of flowers in new images. First, you will need to teach the computer what a flower looks like by showing it thousands of labeled images. After processing this data, the algorithm can start making predictions on its own by analyzing new pictures and identifying the flowers within them. \n\nIn summary, machine learning is about giving computers the ability to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. This has wide-ranging applications in various fields like healthcare, finance, and self-driving cars."
