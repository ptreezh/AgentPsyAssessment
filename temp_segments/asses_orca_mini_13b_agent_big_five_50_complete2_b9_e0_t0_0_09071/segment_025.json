Here's my thought process and approach to handling this situation:\n\n1. Analyze the situation: Firstly, I would assess the reasons behind the sudden increase in workload. Is it due to a breaking news story? A new assignment or investigation? It is crucial to understand the context and prioritize tasks effectively.\n\n2. Utilize time management skills: To efficiently handle the increased workload, I would break down the tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. This includes creating a daily schedule, delegating tasks if possible, and utilizing technology to streamline workflows.\n\n3. Stay focused: Maintaining focus is crucial during times of increased workloads. To combat distractions, I would create a quiet workspace, turn off notifications on my devices, and prioritize deep work periods over shallow tasks like responding to emails.\n\n4. Seek support or assistance: If the workload becomes too heavy, I would not hesitate to delegate tasks or seek help from colleagues. Collaboration is key when working as a part of a team. Additionally, taking care of my own well-being is essential by engaging in self-care activities like exercise and meditation.\n\n5. Adapt and learn: Embracing the challenge of an increased workload could also present an opportunity for professional growth. By learning new skills or improving existing ones, I can become a more efficient and effective investigative journalist.\n\nOverall, my approach to handling an increase in workload involves analyzing the situation, utilizing time management skills, staying focused, seeking support when needed, and adapting to grow as a professional."
