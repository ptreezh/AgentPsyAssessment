I would actively listen and take notes, trying to identify any potential leads for future investigations.\n\n2. If I am unfamiliar with the speaker but still interested in the subject matter, I would likely be attentive and engaged during the speech.

If the situation feels particularly dangerous or if something unexpected occurs, I might decide to cut my losses and exit the event early. This could involve making excuses (e.g., claiming an emergency) or simply leaving without explanation.\n\nOverall, my goal would be to extract as much valuable information as possible from the event while also maintaining my cover as a journalist in order to gather leads for future investigations and protect myself and any potential sources."
