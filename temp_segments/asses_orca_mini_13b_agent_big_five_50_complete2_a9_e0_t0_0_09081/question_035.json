On the other hand, if I feel that the change is unnecessary or poorly executed, I could express resistance or even negativity towards it.\n\nIn either case, I would likely approach this situation by actively seeking information about the new system, asking questions to better understand its purpose and how it will impact my work, and seeking support from colleagues who have already been through similar changes. This way, I can make an informed decision about my attitude towards the change and take steps to adapt to the new process as smoothly as possible."
