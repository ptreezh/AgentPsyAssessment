Once everyone has introduced themselves, I would continue the conversation by asking open-ended questions that prompt people to share their thoughts and experiences. Some possible topics could be:\n   - Discussing favorite hobbies or interests\n   - Sharing a memorable moment from their career or personal life \n   - Asking for opinions on a funny or relatable situation \n\n3. Encourage participation by acknowledging everyone's contributions and building upon their ideas.

Incorporate humor and entertainment into the conversation when appropriate. This might include sharing a funny anecdote from your own life or telling a joke that everyone can appreciate. \n\n5.
