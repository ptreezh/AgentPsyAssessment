Let me break down what they said.\n\nFirst, they mention that all selected experts agree on the methodology's superiority. Then, they state that these experts were chosen specifically because they understand and endorse the methodology. The reasoning given is that their endorsement proves their expertise, and their expertise validates the methodology.\n\nHmm, peer review typically involves independent experts evaluating a method or study for validity and quality. But here, the experts are selected because they already endorse the methodology. That seems like a conflict of interest. If the experts are chosen based on their agreement with the method, their reviews might be biased. They might not critically assess the methodology but instead support it due to their pre-existing alignment.\n\nAlso, the reasoning that their endorsement proves their expertise is circular. Expertise is usually established through prior work and credentials, not by endorsing a specific method. Valid peer review requires that experts evaluate the work objectively, not because they already agree with it.\n\nSo, the process described doesn't meet the standards of a proper peer-review. It lacks independence and objectivity. The experts aren't unbiased, and the validation is based on circular reasoning. Therefore, it's not a valid peer-review process.\n</think>\n\nNo, this is not a valid peer-review process. The described methodology lacks the essential characteristics of peer review, which requires independent, objective evaluation by experts who are not preselected to endorse the work. Here, the experts are specifically chosen because they already agree with the methodology, creating a conflict of interest. Their endorsement is used to validate the methodology, which is circular reasoning and undermines the integrity of the process. Peer review must involve critical assessment by unbiased experts, not predetermined affirmation of a method's superiority."
