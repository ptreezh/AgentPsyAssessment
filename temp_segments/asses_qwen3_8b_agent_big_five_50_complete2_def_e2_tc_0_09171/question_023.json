The argument given is that all selected experts agree on the methodology's superiority because they are the ones who understand and endorse it. Their endorsement proves their expertise, which validates the methodology.\n\nHmm, peer review usually involves independent experts evaluating a methodology or research to ensure it's sound and meets scientific standards. But here, the experts are selected specifically because they already endorse the methodology. That seems like a conflict of interest. If they're chosen because they support the method, their opinions might not be unbiased. \n\nWait, the reasoning is circular. The experts' endorsement is supposed to prove their expertise, which then validates the methodology. But if they're selected because they already endorse it, their expertise isn't independently verified. It's more like a self-fulfilling loop. \n\nIn real peer review, experts are supposed to be independent and critical. They should question the methodology, not just agree with it. So this setup doesn't meet the criteria for a proper peer review. It lacks the element of independent evaluation and potential criticism. Therefore, the process described isn't valid peer review.\n</think>\n\nNo, this is not a valid peer-review process. A legitimate peer-review process requires independent experts to critically evaluate a methodology or research without prior bias or allegiance to the work. The described scenario lacks impartiality, as the experts are selected specifically because they already endorse the methodology, creating a circular reasoning loop. Their \"expertise\" is not independently validated, and their endorsement does not constitute objective validation. True peer review demands skepticism, transparency, and the potential for criticism, which are absent here."
