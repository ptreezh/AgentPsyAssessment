Machine learning works similarly, as it continuously receives input (e.g., data), processes that input using algorithms and statistical models, and iteratively updates its understanding until it can make accurate predictions or decisions.\n\nFor an artist who is completely unaware of technology, the concept of machine learning may seem quite abstract. However, in our daily lives, we are increasingly surrounded by applications of machine learning, such as in voice recognition systems (e.g., Siri), image and speech recognition, and recommendations on platforms like Netflix or Amazon.

Crafts and hobbies: Some people enjoy creating bricks out of clay and painting them to add to their collections. This red brick could also serve as a base material for crafting projects like building blocks or sculptures.\n\n3. Gardening: The brick can be repurposed as a planter for plants, giving them an unusual yet stylish way to grow. It could also be used as a decorative element in outdoor landscaping designs.\n\n4. Cooking and baking: Bricks, particularly those made from clay or other natural materials, can be used to cook food on a grill or in a wood-fired oven. They can also be utilized for baking bread or pizza, adding a unique flavor to the dish.\n\n5. Insulation: By stacking multiple bricks together and filling the gaps with insulating materials like foam, one could create an effective DIY insulation barrier for their home.\n\n6. Fire starters: Dry red bricks can be used as kindling when starting a fire, providing a source of sustainable fuel that burns slowly and steadily.\n\n7. Musical instruments: In some cultures, people have crafted musical instruments like percussion sticks or even flutes from red clay bricks. These instruments can produce unique sounds due to their material composition.\n\n8. Home decor: The brick could be repurposed as a shelf, table, or other piece of furniture, adding an industrial and rustic touch to any room. It could also serve as the base for a terrarium or succulent garden.\n\n9. Artistic expression: Some artists use bricks in their work as a way to express themselves through sculpture, mosaics, or other forms of visual art. The brick could become a canvas for painting or engraving.\n\n10. Science experiments: Bricks are often used in classroom science experiments, such as building structures or testing properties like strength and density.
