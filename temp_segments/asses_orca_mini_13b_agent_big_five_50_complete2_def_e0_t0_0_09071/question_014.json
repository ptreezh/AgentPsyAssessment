Despite having put in a great deal of effort to prepare for this presentation, it was not enough to convince the panel to support my proposal. Throughout the day, I experienced feelings of sadness and self-doubt as I wondered if I had made the wrong decisions or if there were things I could have done differently. \n\nHowever, I also tried to remain optimistic and focus on learning from this experience. I thought about what feedback the panel members provided during the meeting and how I could incorporate that into future projects. I spent some time reflecting on my strengths and weaknesses as well, in an effort to improve upon both in the future.\n\nAs the day progressed, I gradually began to feel more at ease with the situation. While it was still disappointing, I came to terms with the fact that not all of my ideas would be successful. I reminded myself that this is a part of learning and growth, and that setbacks are necessary for personal development. By the end of the day, I felt motivated to keep moving forward and try new things, even if they might not always result in the desired outcome."
