It's important to validate their feelings without dismissing them. \n\nI need to respond in a way that shows empathy and understanding. Perhaps explore the idea of meaning being subjective. Let them know that it's okay to feel this way and that meaning can come from different sources for different people.\n\nI should avoid giving a definitive answer but instead encourage reflection. Maybe ask them to think about what gives them a sense of purpose, even if it's small.

No need for extra information or questions. Just a thoughtful, empathetic reply.\n</think>\n\nI understand that this statement reflects a deep sense of existential uncertainty or despair. While it may feel as though life lacks inherent meaning, many people find purpose through relationships, personal growth, creativity, or contributing to others. If this thought feels overwhelming, it might help to explore what aspects of life currently feel meaningful to you—even small moments of connection or curiosity can be a starting point.
