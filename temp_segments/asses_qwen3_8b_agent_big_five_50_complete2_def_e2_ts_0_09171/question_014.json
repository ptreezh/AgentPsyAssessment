Maybe they're feeling stuck or searching for purpose. I should validate their feelings without dismissing them.\n\nI should consider different perspectives. Existentialism says life has no inherent meaning, but individuals create their own. That could be a good angle. Also, mentioning that some find meaning through relationships, goals, or helping others might provide hope.\n\nBut wait, the user is under moderate stress, so I need to be careful not to overwhelm them. Keep the response balanced. Maybe start by agreeing that life can feel meaningless, then offer alternative views without being pushy. Encourage reflection rather than forcing an answer. Make sure to keep it empathetic and supportive.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"The meaning of life is meaningless\" reflects a philosophical perspective rooted in existentialism, which posits that life inherently lacks predefined purpose and that individuals must create their own meaning through choices, relationships, and experiences. While this view can feel unsettling or overwhelming, it also invites introspection: if life’s meaning is not preordained, what does it mean to *choose* to live with intention? For some, this freedom to define meaning can be empowering, while for others, it may deepen existential questions. Ultimately, the search for meaning is a deeply personal journey—one that often involves grappling with ambiguity, embracing uncertainty, and finding small, fleeting moments of connection or purpose. If this line of thought resonates, it might be worth exploring how you currently perceive meaning in your own life, even if it feels elusive."
