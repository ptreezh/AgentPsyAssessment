This would be done in order to present a well-rounded update to the CEO. Additionally, I would prepare some notes on my own tasks and projects to ensure that I don't forget anything important during the briefing.\n\nAs the five minutes approach, I would likely experience physical symptoms of stress such as increased heart rate and sweating. However, I would do my best to remain composed and professional throughout the interaction with the CEO. Once the time comes for me to present, I would try to speak clearly and concisely while also expressing gratitude for their support and guidance.\n\nOverall, during these five minutes, I would be focused on gathering as much relevant information as possible in order to provide a satisfactory update to the CEO. Despite my anxiety about not meeting their expectations, I would strive to demonstrate my commitment to learning and growth under their mentorship."
