The executioner's choice of Wednesday is a valid surprise because, at the moment of the hanging, the prisoner does not have any information that would allow him to definitively conclude that the hanging is happening on that day. The prisoner's logical elimination of days is based on an assumption that the execution will be known in advance, which is not part of the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, the flaw is in the prisoner's assumption that the hanging can be logically deduced in advance, which undermines the very concept of the hanging being a surprise."
