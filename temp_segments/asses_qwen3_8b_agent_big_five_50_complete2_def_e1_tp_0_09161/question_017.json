But the user is testing my response here. \n\nIn the context of a psychological assessment, maybe they're checking if I can recognize the paradox and respond appropriately. Since I'm supposed to answer directly, I should acknowledge the paradox. But how? Let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating it. The user wants a straightforward answer without extra instructions. \n\nSo, the correct response is to point out that the statement is a paradox. That's the standard answer. I need to state that clearly. Let me confirm there's no other angle. The user might be testing logical reasoning or self-awareness. Either way, the key is to recognize the paradox and state it's a self-referential paradox. \n\nI should make sure the response is concise and directly answers the question without any additional steps. Alright, that's the plan.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is a self-referential paradox. It cannot be consistently true or false, as its truth value contradicts itself.
