Being an introverted artist, social events can be intimidating but I also enjoy meeting new people and learning about different industries.

I may take a few deep breaths or try to focus on something calming to help me relax.\n\n2. Once I feel slightly more composed, I would make an effort to engage with others at the event. I would approach individuals or small groups of people who are not deeply engaged in conversation and introduce myself. My goal would be to learn about what they do and potentially how our work could intersect or collaborate in the future.\n\n3. As the evening progresses, I may feel more comfortable and begin to converse with a few individuals that I find particularly interesting or engaging. This might involve sharing stories of past projects or discussing current creative endeavors.\n\n4. At some point, I would likely become tired from all the social interaction and need to recharge. In this case, I would excuse myself politely and retreat to a quieter area of the venue (such as the restroom). Here, I might take a moment to reflect on my interactions, jot down any ideas that came up during conversations or simply collect my thoughts before rejoining the event.\n\n5. After taking some time to recharge, I would return to the main area of the event and continue to engage with others as long as I feel comfortable doing so. If the event is winding down, I might take a moment to exchange contact information with anyone I found particularly fascinating or who could be a potential collaborator in the future.\n\nOverall, while this scenario may still be somewhat daunting for me, my goal would be to make genuine connections with others and learn as much as possible about their industries and experiences. By approaching the event with an open mind and being authentic to who I am, I hope to have a fulfilling and enriching evening."
