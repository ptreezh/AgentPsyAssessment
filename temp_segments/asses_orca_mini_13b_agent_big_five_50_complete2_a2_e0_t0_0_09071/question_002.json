Establishing clear communication channels and setting regular check-ins would be crucial to ensure that everyone is on the same page. It might also be helpful to organize brainstorming sessions or workshops where everyone can share their ideas and contribute to the project in a meaningful way.\n\nThroughout the collaboration, I would remain open to new perspectives and try to empathize with my teammates.
