This might involve preparing vector files, ensuring that the design is optimized for different resolutions or platforms, and creating guidelines for proper usage of the logo.\n\nIn summary, I would actively participate in the design process by collaborating with my team, brainstorming ideas, refining designs, seeking feedback, and preparing final versions of the logo for various uses.
