The methodology is claimed to be the most effective because all selected experts agree on its superiority. The experts are chosen specifically because they understand and endorse the methodology. Their endorsement proves their expertise, which in turn validates the methodology.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a proper peer-review process entails. Peer review typically involves independent experts evaluating the work for quality, validity, and contribution to the field. It's supposed to be unbiased, with reviewers not having a vested interest in the outcome. The process should include scrutiny, feedback, and sometimes revisions before acceptance.\n\nIn the given scenario, the experts are selected because they already endorse the methodology. That seems like a conflict of interest. If they're chosen based on their agreement with the methodology, their reviews might be biased. They might not critically assess the methodology but instead just affirm it. This lack of critical evaluation undermines the peer-review process. Also, the fact that all experts agree might indicate a lack of diversity in perspectives, which is important for a robust review. \n\nAnother point is that the experts' endorsement is used to prove their expertise, which is circular. Their expertise should be established independently, not through their endorsement of the methodology. Valid peer review should assess the methodology's merits, not just the experts' agreement with it. \n\nSo, putting it all together, this isn't a valid peer-review process because it lacks independence, critical evaluation, and proper validation of expertise. The process described seems more like a form of self-endorsement or a biased approval rather than a genuine peer review.\n</think>\n\nNo, this is not a valid peer-review process. A proper peer-review process requires independent, unbiased evaluation by experts who are not directly affiliated with the methodology or its proponents. The described scenario lacks critical scrutiny, as the experts are selected specifically for their agreement with the methodology rather than their impartiality or expertise in the field. Their endorsement is used to validate the methodology, creating a circular argument rather than an objective assessment. True peer review involves rigorous, independent analysis and potential challenges to the work, not unanimous approval from pre-selected advocates."
