It seems like a good opportunity to explore the brainstorming sessions and find ways to attract users. \n\nPerhaps, the team needs some new ideas to draw users' attention. So, I suggest the following: \n\n1. Encourage team members to experiment with their emotions during the brainstorming sessions. This can help stimulate creativity and generate more innovative ideas. \n2. Use visual aids like diagrams or mind maps to illustrate the ideas generated during the sessions. This can help team members better understand and remember the ideas. \n3. Facilitate the brainstorming sessions with an open-ended question, such as \"What if?\" This can encourage team members to think outside of the box and generate more unique ideas. \n4. Provide a safe space for team members to express their opinions without fear of judgment or criticism. This can help team members feel more comfortable sharing their ideas and collaborating more effectively with one another. \n\nBy incorporating these strategies, the team may be able to attract more users to their legacy product and gain a competitive advantage in the market."
