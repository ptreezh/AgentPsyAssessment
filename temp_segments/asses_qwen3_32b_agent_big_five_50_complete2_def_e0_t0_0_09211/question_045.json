Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I should acknowledge their effort to share the poem. It's important to show appreciation. Maybe start with a positive comment about the poem itself. Then, express gratitude for them sharing it. Also, ask them what aspects they found beautiful to encourage further conversation. I should make sure the response is friendly and open-ended to keep the interaction engaging. Let me check if that covers the key points: appreciation, acknowledgment of their choice, and invitation for more discussion. Yeah, that seems good. Now, structure it in a natural way without being too formal.\n</think>\n\n我会认真倾听朋友的分享，然后说：\"这首诗真的很美，尤其是（具体点出某个意象/句子），让我感受到（描述自己的感受，比如'文字的细腻力量'或'画面的生动感'）。谢谢你愿意和我分享这样打动人心的作品，能告诉我你是从哪里发现它的吗？\" 通过具体反馈和开放提问，既表达了真诚的欣赏，也展现了对话的延续性。"
