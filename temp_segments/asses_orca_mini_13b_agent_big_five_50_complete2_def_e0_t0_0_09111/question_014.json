It was a project that I had put a lot of effort into preparing, and I believed it had great potential for success. Throughout the day, I experienced a range of emotions such as sadness, anger, and self-doubt. \n\nI thought about what went wrong and whether there were things I could have done differently. I wondered if my proposal was too ambitious or if it wasn't well-received due to unforeseen reasons. The rejection made me question my abilities and the validity of my ideas. \n\nTo cope with these feelings, I tried to stay busy with other tasks and activities. I also spent some time talking to colleagues and friends for support and perspective. Overall, though I was disappointed by the outcome, I learned from the experience and became more determined to continue pursuing innovative ideas in the future."
