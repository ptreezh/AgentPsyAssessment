Some individuals may be more prone to anxiety and discomfort in situations where classification and categorization are uncertain or ambiguous. They may seek clarity or certainty to reduce uncertainty and increase efficiency. In contrast, others may be more accepting of ambiguity and uncertainty and may view it as a learning opportunity to explore different possibilities. It is difficult to predict the specific actions that an individual would take without further information about their personality traits, interests, and preferences."
