It looks like this is your first day, so if you have any questions or need help with anything, feel free to ask!\"\n\n2. Smile and engage in light conversation: \"How was your commute today? Did you enjoy our team's welcome gift?\" (If there isn't a specific welcome gift, you can refer to the general office environment or something else that might be of interest).\n\n3.
