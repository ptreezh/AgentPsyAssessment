What is the topic of this piece?\n\nThe topic of this piece is a comparison between two fictional characters, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Gregory House, to determine which one is more brilliant and intelligent. \n\nB. What are some key characteristics that both these characters share in common?\n\nBoth Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Gregory House are portrayed as eccentric geniuses with exceptional intellectual abilities. They possess keen observational skills, remarkable deduction abilities, and a mastery of science (whether it be forensic science for Holmes or medical knowledge for House). Both are known for their arrogance, stubbornness, and tendency to bend the rules in pursuit of solving cases/diagnosing patients.\n\nC. What is your conclusion?\n\nWhile both characters demonstrate brilliant intellects, I would argue that Sherlock Holmes is more brilliant overall. This is because:\n\n1. The stories about him are set in a time period when medical science was less advanced than today. So his deductions were even more impressive considering the limitations of the era. \n\n2. He has solved cases based on minimal clues and limited information, demonstrating incredible deductive reasoning skills. His abilities have been considered almost supernatural at times. \r\n\r\n3. While House is a brilliant diagnostician, Holmes's genius seems to span multiple domains (crime, forensic science, deduction, observation) rather than just being focused on one area like medicine.\r\n\r\n4. The fact that his stories have stood the test of time and remain popular today speaks volumes about their enduring appeal and power of his characterization.\n\nIn conclusion, while both Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Gregory House are incredibly intelligent characters, I believe that Sherlock Holmes's genius shines through in a more impressive way due to the era he is set against and the breadth of his skills."
