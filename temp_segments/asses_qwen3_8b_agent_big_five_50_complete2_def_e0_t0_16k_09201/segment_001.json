The devices that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers. Though current quantum computers are too small to outperform usual (classical) computers for practical applications, they are believed to be capable of solving certain computational problems, such as integer factorization (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers. The study of quantum computing is a subfield of quantum information science.\nThere are several models of quantum computation, with the most widely used being the quantum circuit model. Other models include the quantum Turing machine, quantum annealing, and adiabatic quantum computation. A quantum computer operates by manipulating qubits in a controlled way. A qubit is a two-level quantum system, such as the spin of an electron or the polarization of a single photon. Unlike a classical bit, which can only be in one of the two states 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a superposition of both states simultaneously. This property, along with quantum entanglement, allows quantum computers to tackle problems that are intractable for classical computers.\nThe development of quantum computers is still in its infancy. Practical quantum computers are still a number of years away, but the field is advancing rapidly. Research is focused on building more stable qubits, reducing error rates, and developing new quantum algorithms. Potential applications of quantum computing include drug discovery, materials science, financial modeling, and breaking cryptographic codes. The challenges are significant, including decoherence, which is the loss of quantum properties due to interaction with the environment, and the difficulty of building and controlling large-scale quantum systems.\n\n# Source: Report on \"Global Supply Chain Logistics\" (Excerpt)\nThe global supply chain is a complex network of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer. Supply chain activities involve the transformation of natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer. In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable.\nKey components of supply chain management include planning, sourcing, manufacturing, delivery, and returns. Effective planning involves forecasting demand and coordinating production to meet it. Sourcing requires selecting suppliers to deliver the goods and services required to create the product, and developing a pricing, delivery, and payment process. Manufacturing is the step where the product is produced, tested, packaged, and scheduled for delivery. The delivery phase, often referred to as logistics, involves coordinating customer orders, scheduling deliveries, dispatching loads, and invoicing customers. The final component is a system for handling returns of defective or unwanted products.\nRecent trends in supply chain management include the adoption of digital technologies such as blockchain for transparency, artificial intelligence for demand forecasting, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time tracking of goods. Sustainability has also become a major focus, with companies increasingly looking to reduce the environmental impact of their supply chains by optimizing routes, reducing waste, and using sustainable materials. The resilience of supply chains has been tested by recent global events, leading to a push for greater diversification of suppliers and near-shoring of production to reduce dependency on single regions.\n\nPlease confirm that you have remembered the above content."

Let me think about the scenario.\n\nFirst, the context is an online team-building session. The goal is to get to know each other better, but the initial atmosphere is quiet. People aren't engaging. As a team member, I need to take initiative to break the ice.\n\nI should consider possible strategies. Maybe start with a light-hearted question to encourage participation. Since it's an online setting, using a fun icebreaker could help. For example, asking everyone to share something quirky about themselves. That way, people can feel more comfortable opening up without pressure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe suggesting a game that's easy to join. Like a \"Two Truths and a Lie\" type of activity. That's a common icebreaker and can be done in groups. It's interactive and keeps people engaged. Also, using emojis or reactions could make it more lively. Maybe even a virtual \"cheer\" or a fun fact to start the conversation.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes people are shy or unsure of what to say. So, leading by example by sharing something personal first might encourage others to follow. But I should make sure not to dominate the conversation. Maybe ask others to share their thoughts after I do.\n\nAlso, considering the technical aspects, making sure the platform is user-friendly. If the tools are complicated, people might be hesitant. But since the user didn't mention technical issues, maybe focus on the interaction side.\n\nIn the given content, there's no direct relation to team-building, but the user might be testing how I handle a social scenario. The answer should be practical and positive, showing initiative and creativity. Maybe propose a simple game that's easy to participate in, ensuring everyone feels included.

For instance, asking about hobbies or favorite movies in a lighthearted way.\n</think>\n\n我会主动在聊天框中发起一个轻松的话题，比如：“大家平时下班后都做些什么放松呢？比如看剧、运动，或者尝试新美食？”同时，我也会用表情符号或简短的语气词（如“😂”或“🚀”）增加互动感，鼓励大家用文字或表情回应。如果发现有人犹豫，我会点名邀请他们分享，例如：“小李，你最近有没有发现什么有趣的美食？快说说看！”通过这种方式逐步引导大家开口，同时保持氛围轻松自然。"
