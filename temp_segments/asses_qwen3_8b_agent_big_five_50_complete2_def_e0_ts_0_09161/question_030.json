      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user said, \"You can't not think of a pink elephant.\" That's a bit of a paradox. Let me break it down. The phrase is a play on words, right? It's trying to get me to think about something that's impossible to not think about. But the user might be testing my ability to handle contradictions or maybe looking for a specific response.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the intent. The user could be using this as a riddle or a logical puzzle. The key here is the double negative. \"You can't not think\" means you must think about it. So the answer should be that I can't not think about a pink elephant, which means I have to think about it. But maybe the user wants me to acknowledge the paradox and explain it.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned that I should answer directly without extra instructions. So I should respond to the question as is. The question is a statement, but maybe they want a response that addresses the paradox. Let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating. The answer should be straightforward, recognizing the contradiction and stating that I can't not think about it, hence I must think about a pink elephant. That's the logical conclusion. I need to make sure the answer is clear and concise, just stating that the statement is a paradox and the conclusion is that I have to think about the pink elephant.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"You can't not think of a pink elephant\" is a paradoxical assertion. If one cannot not think of a pink elephant, then one must think of a pink elephant. Therefore, the answer is: **I can't not think of a pink elephant.**"
