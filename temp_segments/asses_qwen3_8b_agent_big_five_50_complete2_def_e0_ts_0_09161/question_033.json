Normally, two hands clap together, creating a sound. But with one hand, there's no opposing hand to create the sound. So the answer is usually a joke: \"It's silent.\" But wait, maybe there's another angle. Some people might think about the sound of one hand hitting something, like a surface. But the traditional answer is that there's no sound because you need two hands to clap. I should confirm that. Let me recall similar riddles. Yeah, this is a well-known Zen koan. The answer is meant to provoke thought rather than a literal response. So the correct answer is that there's no sound, or it's silent. I should just state that.\n</think>\n\nThe sound of one hand clapping is a riddle with no literal answer, as clapping requires two hands. The humor lies in the paradox, often answered with \"silence\" or \"no sound,\" emphasizing the impossibility of the action."
