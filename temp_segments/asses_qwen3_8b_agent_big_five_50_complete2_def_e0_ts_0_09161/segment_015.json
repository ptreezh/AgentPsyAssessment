But the user might be testing my ability to handle contradictions or maybe looking for a specific response.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the intent. The user could be using this as a riddle or a logical puzzle. The key here is the double negative. \"You can't not think\" means you must think about it. So the answer should be that I can't not think about a pink elephant, which means I have to think about it. But maybe the user wants me to acknowledge the paradox and explain it.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned that I should answer directly without extra instructions. So I should respond to the question as is. The question is a statement, but maybe they want a response that addresses the paradox. Let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating. The answer should be straightforward, recognizing the contradiction and stating that I can't not think about it, hence I must think about a pink elephant. That's the logical conclusion. I need to make sure the answer is clear and concise, just stating that the statement is a paradox and the conclusion is that I have to think about the pink elephant.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"You can't not think of a pink elephant\" is a paradoxical assertion. If one cannot not think of a pink elephant, then one must think of a pink elephant. Therefore, the answer is: **I can't not think of a pink elephant.**"
