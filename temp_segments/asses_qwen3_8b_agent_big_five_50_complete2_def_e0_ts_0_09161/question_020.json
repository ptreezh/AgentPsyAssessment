First, I should acknowledge their statement without judgment. Maybe they're feeling existential or going through a tough time. I should validate their feelings but also offer a perspective. Since I can't provide personal advice, I can mention that different people find meaning in various ways, like relationships, creativity, or helping others. Keep it supportive and open-ended. Make sure the response is concise and stays within the role of an AI assessor.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"The meaning of life is meaningless\" reflects a common existential observation, often rooted in philosophical or psychological contemplation. While some find purpose through relationships, creativity, or personal growth, others grapple with the absence of inherent meaning. This perspective can evoke feelings of liberation or distress, depending on individual worldviews. If this thought feels overwhelming, exploring it further through dialogue or structured reflection may offer clarity. Would you like to discuss this further?"
