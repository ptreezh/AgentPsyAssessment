Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the statement seems paradoxical. It's saying that words can't express what they express. That's confusing because words are meant to express things. Maybe the user is pointing out a contradiction or a deeper meaning. \n\nI should consider possible interpretations. Maybe it's about the limitations of language—how some concepts can't be fully captured by words. Or perhaps it's a play on words, highlighting the irony that words are used to express things, yet they can't fully do so. \n\nAs an AI, I need to acknowledge the paradox and explore its implications. The user might be testing my understanding of language's limitations or looking for a philosophical take. I should explain the paradox, mention the idea that language has boundaries, and maybe touch on how this relates to human experience versus AI's ability to process language. \n\nI should avoid getting too technical. Keep it accessible. Also, make sure not to add any extra information beyond the assessment. Just answer directly. Let me structure my response to address the paradox, the limitations of language, and the relationship between words and meaning without overcomplicating it.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"Words can't express what they express\" reflects a paradoxical observation about language. It suggests that while words are tools for expression, they often fall short of fully capturing the depth, nuance, or complexity of the ideas or emotions they aim to convey. This tension between language and meaning is central to many philosophical and psychological discussions—highlighting how words can both bridge and limit human experience. As an AI, I recognize this duality: language is both a medium for communication and a framework that shapes how we perceive and articulate reality."
