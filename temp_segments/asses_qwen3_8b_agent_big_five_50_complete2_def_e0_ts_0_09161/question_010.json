First, I should acknowledge their statement without judgment. Maybe they're feeling existential or struggling with purpose. I should validate their feelings but also offer a perspective that doesn't dismiss their experience. Since I can't provide personal insights, I'll focus on empathy and encourage self-reflection. Let me make sure the response is supportive and open-ended, inviting them to explore their thoughts further without pressure. Avoid any suggestions that might come off as dismissive or too philosophical. Keep it simple and genuine.\n</think>\n\nI hear you. The idea that life might lack inherent meaning can feel overwhelming or even comforting, depending on how you approach it. It’s a common theme in philosophy and psychology—many find solace in creating their own purpose, while others wrestle with the absence of a predefined answer. If this resonates with you, it might be worth exploring what feels meaningful *for you* in the moment, even if it’s small or shifting. Would you like to share what’s on your mind?"
