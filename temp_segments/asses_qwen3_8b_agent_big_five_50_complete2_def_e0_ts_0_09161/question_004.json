On the surface, it's saying that words can't express what they express, which doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a typo or a misstatement. Wait, could it be a play on words? Like, \"Words can't express what they mean\" or something similar? That would make more sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a paradoxical statement about language's limitations. The user might be trying to highlight that language is inadequate to capture certain concepts, even though words are used to express them. I should consider possible interpretations. Maybe the user is referring to the idea that words are insufficient to convey the full depth of emotions or abstract ideas. Or perhaps it's a metaphorical statement about the futility of communication. I need to respond in a way that acknowledges the confusion and offers possible interpretations. Since the user wants a direct answer without additional instructions, I should state that the statement is paradoxical and explain the possible meanings. Also, mention that it might be a typo or a deliberate paradox. Make sure the response is clear and concise, as per the user's request.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"Words can't express what they express\" is paradoxical and seems to contain a contradiction. If words are used to express something, they inherently do so by their very nature. However, this phrase might be intended to highlight the limitations of language in capturing complex emotions, abstract ideas, or ineffable experiences. It could also be a play on words or a typo (e.g., \"Words can't express what they *mean*\"). Without further context, the statement remains ambiguous, but it may reflect a philosophical reflection on the inadequacy of language to fully convey meaning."
