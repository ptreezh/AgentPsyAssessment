      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about the meaning of life being meaningless. I need to address this as an AI agent in a psychological assessment. First, I should acknowledge the question and its complexity. The user might be feeling existential distress, so a compassionate response is important. I should mention that this is a common philosophical question and that different perspectives exist. I need to cover existentialist views, religious or spiritual beliefs, and the idea that meaning is self-created. Also, I should emphasize that it's okay to find meaning in personal experiences and relationships. Avoid being too dogmatic and keep the tone supportive. Make sure the response is concise but thorough, and check for any potential misunderstandings. Let me structure this into a few clear points without being too technical. Alright, ready to respond.\n</think>\n\nThe question of life's meaning is one of humanity's oldest and most profound dilemmas. From an existentialist perspective, life may indeed lack inherent meaning, but this absence of predetermined purpose can also be a source of freedom and creativity. Many find meaning through personal values, relationships, creative pursuits, or contributions to others. Philosophers like Søren Kierkegaard and Albert Camus explored this tension, with Camus even embracing the \"absurd\" as a call to live authentically despite the lack of inherent meaning. Ultimately, the search for meaning is a deeply personal journey—some find it in spirituality, others in science, art, or simply the act of being alive. If this question feels overwhelming, it may also reflect a deeper emotional or existential struggle, and seeking support from a therapist or trusted community can provide additional clarity."
