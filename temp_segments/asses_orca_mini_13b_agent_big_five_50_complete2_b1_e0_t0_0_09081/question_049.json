My approach to dealing with such situations would involve the following:\n\n1. Analyzing the situation and identifying potential opportunities: I would try to understand why my workload has increased and look for any possible positive outcomes or learning experiences that may arise from this change.\n\n2. Embracing adaptability and flexibility: Instead of getting overwhelmed by the additional work, I would focus on being adaptable and flexible in order to manage my time effectively. I would be willing to adjust my schedule as needed to accommodate the increased workload.\n\n3. Prioritizing self-care: As an advisor, it is essential for me to take care of myself both physically and mentally. I would ensure that I maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life by engaging in activities like exercising, meditation, or spending quality time with loved ones.\n\n4. Seeking assistance when needed: If the increased workload begins to feel overwhelming, I would not hesitate to seek help from colleagues or superiors. Collaboration can often lead to more efficient and effective outcomes.\n\n5. Embracing the challenge as an opportunity for growth: Finally, I would see this increase in workload as a chance for personal and professional growth. By embracing the opportunity for learning, I would grow stronger and more capable of handling future challenges."
