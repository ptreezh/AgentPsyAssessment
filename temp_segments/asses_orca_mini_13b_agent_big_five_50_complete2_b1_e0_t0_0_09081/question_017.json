Before we dive into the work today, do you have any favorite hobbies or activities that you enjoy doing in your free time? It can be helpful to know what people like to do outside of work, as it often reflects their passions and creativity.\"\n\nThis question would encourage them to share something personal about themselves, helping the team member feel more connected and accepted within the group.
