Initial thoughts: Upon receiving the notification, I would feel a mix of pressure and motivation. The pressure comes from the short deadline and the importance of the report for my career, while the motivation stems from wanting to present myself as competent and effective in my role.\n\n2. Assessing the situation: To create an effective report, I would quickly assess the current status of my work progress, identifying any outstanding tasks or issues that need to be addressed. This would involve reviewing project plans, checking communication channels, and possibly consulting with team members if necessary.\n\n3. Prioritizing tasks: Based on the assessment, I would prioritize the tasks required to complete the report and create an action plan for how I will accomplish this in the remaining time. This may involve delegating some tasks or requesting assistance from a colleague to help speed up the process.\n\n4. Organizing thoughts: To ensure that my report is clear, concise, and effective, I would organize my thoughts on each task, highlighting key achievements and any challenges faced during the progress of the work. This may involve creating bullet points or a mind map to help keep track of the information.\n\n5. Drafting the report: Once my thoughts are organized, I would begin drafting the report, ensuring that it remains focused on the CEO's main concerns and goals for the project. I might use an existing template or format, depending on company guidelines.\n\n6. Proofreading and editing: As I near the end of the five-minute period, I would dedicate the remaining time to proofreading and editing the report. This would involve checking for grammatical errors, typos, and ensuring that the information is presented clearly and effectively.\n\n7. Submitting the report: Just before the deadline, I would submit my report to the CEO via email or other communication platform specified in the instructions. If possible, I may also consider scheduling a follow-up meeting to discuss the report further and address any questions or concerns.\n\nIn summary, during the five-minute period leading up to the briefing with the company CEO, I would be focused on assessing my work progress, prioritizing tasks, organizing thoughts, drafting the report, proofreading and editing it, and submitting it before the deadline. This would involve managing pressure and motivation while ensuring an effective communication of my accomplishments to date."
