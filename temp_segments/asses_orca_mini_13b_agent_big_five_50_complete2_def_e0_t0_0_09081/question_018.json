I would create a systematic naming convention for files to make them easily identifiable and accessible. Additionally, I would categorize the files into folders based on their type or purpose, making it simpler for team members to locate relevant information.\n\nTo achieve this, I would first propose a plan to my team regarding the organization of the cloud folder. This may include holding a meeting or sending out an email detailing the new system and requesting input from other team members. Once we agree on a plan, I would then dedicate time to organize the files accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, my response to this situation would be to take initiative in streamlining our cloud folder organization for better collaboration and efficiency among the team members."
