Here is how I would schedule the 3 hours:\n\n1. Firstly, I would allocate the initial few minutes for preparation. This could include reviewing any relevant materials, familiarizing myself with the task at hand and setting up any equipment needed.\n2. Next, I would dedicate about an hour to focus on the more cognitively demanding tasks that require a high level of concentration. During this time, I would avoid distractions such as social media or phone calls in order to maintain my concentration.\n3. After an hour, I would take a short break for 5-10 minutes to refresh my mind and body. This could involve stretching, having a glass of water, or using the restroom.\n4. Following the break, I would allocate another hour of focused work on the task at hand.\n5. Towards the end of the 3 hours, I would assess my progress and evaluate if I am on track to complete the task within the allotted time. If necessary, I would adjust my remaining time accordingly.\n6. Finally, I would dedicate the last few minutes for wrapping up any loose ends and documenting final thoughts or notes about the task.\n\nBy following this plan, I believe I can effectively use the 3 hours allocated to complete the complex task at hand with a high level of focus and productivity."
