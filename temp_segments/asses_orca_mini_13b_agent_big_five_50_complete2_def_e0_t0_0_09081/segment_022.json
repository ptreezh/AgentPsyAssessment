By setting these short-term objectives, I can track my progress and stay motivated throughout the process.\n\nIf I still encounter difficulties and roadblocks during the learning process, I would try to troubleshoot the issue by seeking help from a tutor or fellow learners in an online community.

Seeking help from others and exploring additional resources can also be beneficial in overcoming these difficulties."
