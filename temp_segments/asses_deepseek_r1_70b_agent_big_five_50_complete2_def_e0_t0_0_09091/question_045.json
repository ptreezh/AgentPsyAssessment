Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should show appreciation for their effort. They took the time to write something and share it with me, which means they value my opinion. So, saying \"谢谢\" is a good start because it acknowledges their gesture.\n\nNext, I want to compliment the poem itself. Maybe mention that it's beautiful or well-written. Using words like \"写得很美\" feels natural and genuine.\n\nBut just complimenting might not be enough. I should also ask for more engagement. Asking them what inspired them can show that I'm interested in their creative process and value their thoughts beyond the poem itself.\n\nPutting it all together, my response should be warm, appreciative, and inviting further conversation.\n</think>\n\n谢谢你与我分享这首诗！我觉得写得很美，能不能告诉我一下你是在什么时候或因为什么灵感而创作的呢？"
