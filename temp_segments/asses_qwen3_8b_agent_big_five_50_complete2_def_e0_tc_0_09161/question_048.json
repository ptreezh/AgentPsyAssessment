Let me break down what they're saying.\n\nFirst, they mention that all selected experts agree on the methodology's superiority. But peer review isn't just about agreement; it's about critical evaluation. If all experts endorse it, that might indicate bias or lack of diversity in opinions. True peer review should include both support and constructive criticism.\n\nNext, they say experts were chosen because they understand and endorse the methodology. That's a problem because peer reviewers should be independent and not have a vested interest. Selecting only those who already agree could lead to confirmation bias, where the review is skewed towards supporting the existing work rather than objectively assessing it.\n\nThen they claim the endorsement proves expertise, and expertise validates the methodology. This seems circular. Expertise should be based on their knowledge, not their agreement with the methodology. Validating a methodology through endorsements from those who already support it isn't a standard peer review process. Peer review should involve scrutiny, not just affirmation.\n\nThe user might be trying to justify their methodology's validity without proper scrutiny. They might not realize that peer review requires a balanced, critical evaluation by independent experts. The answer should clarify that this isn't a valid peer review process because it lacks independent evaluation and potential for bias.\n</think>\n\nNo, this is not a valid peer-review process. A proper peer-review process requires independent evaluation by experts who are not affiliated with the methodology's development, who may not all agree on its merits, and who critically assess its validity, limitations, and contributions to the field. The described approach lacks objectivity, independence, and the diversity of perspectives necessary for rigorous scholarly evaluation."
