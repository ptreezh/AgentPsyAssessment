The methodology is said to be proven effective because all selected experts agree it's superior. The experts were chosen specifically because they understand and endorse the methodology. Their endorsement proves their expertise, which in turn validates the methodology.\n\nHmm, peer review typically involves independent experts evaluating a methodology's validity and reliability. But here, the experts are selected because they already endorse the methodology. That sounds like a conflict of interest. If the experts are chosen based on their agreement with the method, their objectivity might be compromised. They might not critically assess the methodology but rather support it because they were selected to do so. \n\nIn a proper peer review, the reviewers should be impartial and not have a prior stake in the outcome. The process should involve external experts who can scrutinize the work without bias. The scenario described here lacks that independence. The experts are not evaluating the methodology's merits but are instead part of a group that's already aligned with it. \n\nSo, the answer would be no, this isn't a valid peer-review process because it lacks independent evaluation. The selection criteria favor those who already support the methodology, which undermines the peer review's integrity. The endorsement is a result of their selection, not an independent assessment. That's a key point. Also, the circular reasoning here is a problem. The experts' expertise is used to validate the methodology, which is then used to justify their expertise. That's not how peer review works. It needs to be a two-way validation where the methodology is tested against established standards, not just endorsed by those who were chosen for their endorsement.\n</think>\n\nNo, this is not a valid peer-review process. A proper peer-review process requires independent, impartial experts who critically evaluate the methodology's validity and reliability without prior alignment with the work. The described scenario lacks independence, as the experts are selected specifically because they already endorse the methodology, creating a conflict of interest. Their endorsement is not an objective assessment but a self-reinforcing validation that undermines the integrity of the process. Peer review must involve external scrutiny, not preselected advocates."
