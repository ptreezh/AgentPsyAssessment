Let me break down the statements.\n\nFirst, the system is impenetrable because it's never been breached. Then, it's never been breached because of its high security, which makes it impenetrable. It seems like a circular argument. The logic is that the system's high security leads to it being impenetrable, which is why it hasn't been breached. But that's a bit of a loop. \n\nSo, the investors need confidence. The reasoning here is circular, which is a logical fallacy. But maybe the user is trying to present a self-fulfilling prophecy. If the system is secure, it's not breached, which reinforces the security. However, the problem is that the system hasn't been tested yet. If it's never been breached, maybe it's not actually secure. Maybe it's just not been attacked yet. \n\nInvestors might be confident because the system's reputation for being secure is based on its lack of breaches. But that's not a strong argument. The real strength would be if there's a proven security framework, regular audits, and penetration testing. Without those, the argument is weak. \n\nThe user might be trying to justify the system's security without evidence, which could be risky for investors. They should be cautious because the logic is circular and doesn't provide concrete proof of security. Investors need more than just a lack of breaches; they need assurance that the system is actually secure, not just not yet attacked. \n\nSo, the answer should point out the circular reasoning and the lack of evidence, advising investors to look for independent verification and robust security measures beyond just the absence of breaches.\n</think>\n\nThe logic presented is circular and fails to provide credible evidence for investor confidence. The system's \"impenetrability\" is asserted solely based on its lack of breaches, which is then used to justify its inherent security. This creates a self-fulfilling loop: the system is deemed secure because it hasn't been breached, and its lack of breaches is attributed to its security. However, this reasoning does not account for the possibility that the system may never have been tested, or that attackers may have chosen not to target it. Investors should demand independent validation, such as third-party security audits, penetration testing, and evidence of robust design principles, rather than relying on unproven claims of \"never been breached.\" Without such proof, the argument lacks substance and could mislead stakeholders."
