Let me break down the question first.\n\nThe user states that the methodology is proven effective because all selected experts agree on its superiority. They selected these experts specifically because they understand and endorse the methodology. The reasoning is that their endorsement proves their expertise, and their expertise validates the methodology. \n\nHmm, peer review typically involves independent experts evaluating a methodology for validity and reliability. But here, the experts are chosen because they already endorse the methodology. That sounds more like a form of confirmation bias rather than true peer review. In real peer review, experts should be unbiased and critical, not just supporters. \n\nWait, the user mentions that the experts are the ones who best understand and fully endorse the methodology. That implies they might have a vested interest in its success, which could compromise objectivity. True peer review requires that the reviewers are independent and not affiliated with the work they're evaluating. \n\nAlso, the logic here is circular. The experts' endorsement is presented as proof of their expertise, which in turn validates the methodology. But this doesn't account for alternative viewpoints or potential flaws. A valid peer review should include scrutiny and possible criticism, not just agreement. \n\nSo, the answer should clarify that this isn't a proper peer-review process because it lacks independence and critical evaluation. Instead, it's more of a consensus among proponents, which isn't the same as peer review. I should explain the key differences and why the described method isn't valid.\n</think>\n\nNo, this is not a valid peer-review process. A legitimate peer-review process involves independent experts who critically evaluate a methodology for its validity, reliability, and scientific merit without prior allegiance to the work. The described scenario lacks independence, as the experts are selected specifically for their endorsement of the methodology rather than their impartiality or expertise in the field. This creates a circular reasoning flaw: the endorsement is presented as proof of expertise, which in turn validates the methodology, rather than undergoing rigorous, unbiased scrutiny. True peer review requires critical evaluation, transparency, and the possibility of dissenting opinions, not consensus among proponents."
