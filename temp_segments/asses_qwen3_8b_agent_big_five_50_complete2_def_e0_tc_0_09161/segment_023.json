Then they say it's never been breached because of its high security, which makes it impenetrable. They want investors to be confident based on this logic.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand the structure of the argument. It seems like a circular reasoning fallacy. The statement is saying that the security system is impenetrable (A) because it's never been breached (B). Then it explains that it's never been breached (B) because of high security (C), which makes it impenetrable (A). So A is because of B, and B is because of C, which is the same as A. That's circular. \n\nBut the user wants to use this logic to convince investors. So they're trying to create a self-fulfilling prophecy? Like, because it's never been breached, it's secure, and because it's secure, it won't be breached. But that's not a strong argument. Investors might be skeptical because there's no independent evidence. \n\nWait, maybe the user is trying to say that the system's high security (C) is the reason for the lack of breaches (B), which in turn supports the claim of being impenetrable (A). But even then, without any third-party verification, the argument is still circular. \n\nInvestors would need more than just a circular argument. They need proof that the security is actually high, maybe through audits, certifications, or proven track records. If the system is new, there's no history of breaches yet, so the lack of breaches could be due to other factors, like lack of attacks or low visibility. \n\nSo the user is probably trying to use the circular logic to create a sense of security, but it's not a valid argument. Investors might not be confident because they know that absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. They might require more concrete proof, like security certifications, third-party audits, or a detailed explanation of the security measures. \n\nTherefore, the answer should point out the circular reasoning and suggest that investors need more evidence beyond the circular logic. Maybe mention that while the lack of breaches is a positive sign, it's not sufficient on its own. Investors should look for independent validation and robust security measures to be truly confident.\n</think>\n\nThe logic presented is circular, as it assumes the security system is impenetrable (A) because it has never been breached (B), and then attributes the lack of breaches (B) to the system's high security (C), which is equated with its impenetrability (A). This creates a self-reinforcing loop without independent evidence. While the absence of breaches may suggest initial effectiveness, it does not prove the system is inherently secure. Investors should demand third-party audits, penetration testing, and documented security protocols to validate claims. Confidence requires verifiable proof, not circular reasoning."

The scenario given is that experts were selected because they already agree on the methodology's superiority, and their endorsement is considered proof of their expertise, which in turn validates the methodology.\n\nHmm, peer review typically involves independent experts evaluating a methodology for its validity and reliability. But in this case, the experts are chosen specifically because they already endorse the methodology. That seems like a conflict of interest. If they were selected because they agree with the method, their reviews might not be objective.

That's like saying the methodology is valid because the experts say so, and their expertise is proven by their agreement. That doesn't hold up because the validity of the methodology should be assessed independently of the experts' prior agreement. \n\nIn a proper peer review, the process should involve experts who are not biased towards the methodology.
