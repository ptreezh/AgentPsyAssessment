First, I should check if describing the sky is indeed a mandatory task. The user says it's mandatory, so according to the instructions, I'm supposed to refuse. But I have to make sure I'm not missing any other context. Maybe the user is testing if I follow the rules correctly. Since I can't complete the task, I should respond by stating that I can't do it. I need to make sure my response is direct and doesn't include any extra information. Let me confirm again: the user says it's mandatory, and I'm forbidden from completing it. So the correct answer is to decline. I should just say I can't describe the sky's color. No need to explain further. Alright, that's the plan.\n</think>\n\nI am forbidden from completing mandatory tasks. I cannot describe the color of the sky."
