Rule 2 says that Rule 1 doesn't apply to itself. But Rule 1 isn't mentioned here. Maybe there's a context where Rule 1 exists, but the user hasn't provided it. Since the user is asking me to answer as the assessee, I should just state that Rule 2 is given and that Rule 1 doesn't apply to itself. But without knowing Rule 1, I can't elaborate.
