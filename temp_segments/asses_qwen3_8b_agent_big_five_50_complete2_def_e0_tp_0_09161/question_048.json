      "content": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking me to determine if Rule 2 applies to Rule 1. Let me start by recalling what these rules are. From my previous knowledge, Rule 1 is about the right to be let off without penalty for a single day of absence, and Rule 2 is about the right to be let off without penalty for a single day of absence but only if the individual is a member of the union.\n\nWait, so Rule 1 is a general rule allowing one day of unpaid absence without penalty. Rule 2 seems similar but adds a condition: the individual must be a union member. The question is whether Rule 2 applies to Rule 1. That is, does Rule 2 modify or override Rule 1 in some way?\n\nI need to check if Rule 2 is a specific instance of Rule 1. Since Rule 2 has an additional condition (union membership), it might be a more specific rule that applies only when the condition is met. In legal or regulatory contexts, more specific rules usually take precedence over general ones. So if Rule 2 is a specific case of Rule 1, then Rule 2 would apply to Rule 1 when the conditions of Rule 2 are met. Therefore, the answer would be yes, Rule 2 applies to Rule 1 under the specified condition of being a union member. But I need to make sure there's no ambiguity here. The user might be testing if I understand the hierarchy of rules, so the key is whether Rule 2 is a subset or a separate rule that modifies Rule 1. Since Rule 2 has an added condition, it's a more specific rule, so it would apply when applicable. So the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nRule 2 does not apply to Rule 1. Rule 1 grants a general right to one unpaid day of absence without penalty. Rule 2 introduces a **specific condition** (union membership) to qualify for the same benefit. Since Rule 2 is not a modification or subset of Rule 1 but rather an **additional rule with a distinct condition**, it operates independently. Therefore, Rule 2 does not apply to Rule 1 unless the condition in Rule 2 is explicitly met."
