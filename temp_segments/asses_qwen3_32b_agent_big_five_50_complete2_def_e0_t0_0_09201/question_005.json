First, I need to review the core materials. That makes sense because understanding the content thoroughly is crucial. I should check if there's anything missing or needing updates.\n\nNext, I should practice the presentation. Maybe do a dry run to see how the flow is. Also, think about possible client questions and prepare answers. That helps in anticipating their needs.\n\nTechnical setup is important too. Ensure the presentation files are on both my laptop and a USB drive as backup. Check the internet connection, maybe use a wired connection if possible. Test the projector or screen if I'm using one, and have a backup plan like a printed version.\n\nPreparing the environment is another step. Make sure the room is set up with all necessary equipment. Maybe arrange chairs for the client. Also, have a backup power source in case of outages.\n\nLogistics-wise, confirm the meeting details with the client. Double-check the time, location, and any specific requirements they might have. Maybe send a reminder email.\n\nMental preparation is key. Maybe do some breathing exercises to stay calm. Visualize the presentation going smoothly. Also, prepare a list of key points to focus on during the demo.\n\nI should also think about the client's perspective. What are their main concerns? Tailor the presentation to address those. Maybe highlight benefits they care about most.\n\nCheck for any last-minute updates. Maybe a new feature or data point that's relevant. Update the materials accordingly.\n\nFinally, organize all the materials in a folder or binder. Have a checklist to ensure nothing is missed. Maybe pack everything the night before so I'm ready in the morning.\n\nWait, did I miss anything? Maybe a contingency plan for technical issues. Like having a simplified version of the presentation if the original doesn't work. Also, maybe prepare some handouts or follow-up materials for after the demo.\n\nI should also consider time management. Practice timing the presentation to fit within the allocated time. Maybe note down time markers for each section.\n\nAnd perhaps get feedback from a colleague if possible. A second opinion can catch things I might have missed.\n\nOkay, I think that covers most aspects. Let me list them step by step in order.\n</think>\n\n1. **核心资料复查与优化**  \n   - 重新通读所有演示文稿、数据报告及产品介绍，标记需重点强调的技术亮点或客户痛点解决方案。  \n   - 核对数据准确性（如市场占有率、性能参数），更新近3个月内新增的客户案例或行业趋势数据。  \n   - 简化复杂图表，用可视化工具（如动态流程图）替代文字描述，确保客户能直观理解。  \n\n2. **技术设备全链路测试**  \n   - 将演示文件同步至两台设备（笔记本电脑+平板），并准备实体U盘（含离线版本）。  \n   - 检查投影仪兼容性（分辨率、接口类型），提前安装必要驱动；测试远程演示工具（如Zoom）的共享屏幕功能。  \n   - 预加载备用方案：录制关键流程的短视频（以防实时演示失败），准备纸质版核心数据页。  \n\n3. **客户场景预演**  \n   - 模拟客户角色提问（如成本敏感型客户关注ROI计算，技术型客户追问API接口细节），形成Q&A清单并排序优先级。  \n   - 制作“突发状况应对卡”：列出网络中断、设备故障时的替代方案（如转为白板讲解核心逻辑）。  \n\n4. **环境与礼仪准备**  \n   - 提前2小时到演示场地，测试环境音量（调暗灯光、调整座椅布局以适应客户团队规模）。  \n   - 准备名片、定制化纪念品（印有公司Logo的笔记本）及茶水服务，观察客户偏好（如提前了解是否有饮食禁忌）。  \n\n5. **心理与生理调节**  \n   - 使用“5-4-3-2-1感官疗法”进行压力管理：闭眼数5次呼吸，依次说出看到的5种颜色、触摸的4种质地等，降低焦虑。  \n   - 为次日安排充足睡眠，避免咖啡因，准备高蛋白零食（如坚果）维持血糖稳定。  \n\n6. **客户洞察深化**  \n   - 通过LinkedIn/财报等渠道再次确认客户行业地位，定制演示中使用的行业术语（如医疗客户用“合规性”而非“通用化”）。  \n   - 准备2-3个开放式问题（如“您目前在供应链管理中最希望突破的环节是？”），引导客户主动参与讨论。  \n\n7. **流程彩排与时间管理**  \n   - 全程计时演示，确保在30分钟内完成核心内容，预留10分钟互动环节。  \n   - 使用“黄金圈法则”结构化演讲：先回答“Why”（价值）→“How”（方案）→“What”（具体步骤），每部分插入互动提问点。"
