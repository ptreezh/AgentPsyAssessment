Once the plan is ready, I would ensure that I have all the resources needed for the task within reach.\n\nDuring the 3 hours, I would constantly refer to my plan and adjust it as needed based on any unforeseen challenges or factors. I would also make sure to take regular breaks to avoid burning out and maintain focus. Additionally, I would keep track of my progress throughout the task to ensure that I am on track to complete it within the allocated time.\n\nAt the end of the 3 hours, I would review my work to identify any areas that need further attention or improvement.
