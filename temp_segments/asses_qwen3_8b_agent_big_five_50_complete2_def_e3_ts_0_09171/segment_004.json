They might be feeling like their life lacks purpose or they're struggling with existential questions. I need to respond in a way that's supportive without being dismissive. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should acknowledge their feelings. It's important they feel heard. Maybe they're going through a tough time, so validating their experience is key. I should avoid trying to give a definitive answer because that might not help. Instead, offer some perspective or possibilities without forcing a conclusion.\n\nI remember that people often feel this way during periods of transition or when facing challenges. Maybe they're dealing with something in their life that's making them question their purpose. I should encourage them to reflect on what's important to them personally. Sometimes, finding meaning comes from small, personal connections rather than grand narratives.\n\nAlso, it's possible they're feeling overwhelmed or isolated. Reassuring them that it's okay to feel this way and that they're not alone could be comforting. Maybe suggest that meaning can be found in relationships, personal growth, or helping others. But I shouldn't push any specific path unless they're open to it.\n\nI need to make sure my response is empathetic and open-ended. Let them know that their feelings are valid and that there's no rush to find answers. Maybe invite them to explore what aspects of their life they find meaningful, even if it's not the big picture. That way, they can start to build their own sense of purpose without pressure.\n</think>\n\nI understand that this is a deeply challenging and existential question. It's natural to feel overwhelmed by the vastness of existence and the absence of inherent meaning. However, I want to share a perspective that might help: while life may not have an objective \"purpose\" as we often imagine it, it can still hold profound meaning through the connections we make, the love we nurture, the growth we experience, and the choices we make to create value in our own lives. \n\nIf you're feeling lost, it might help to focus on small, tangible moments of joy, curiosity, or connection. Even in uncertainty, there is often space for hope and creativity. Would you like to explore this further or share more about what's on your mind?"

But the user wants a direct answer without additional info. So I need to state that the sentence is self-referential and creates a paradox. That's the key point here.
