First, I need to acknowledge their statement without dismissing it. They might be feeling lost or overwhelmed, so I should validate their feelings.\n\nI should consider different perspectives on the meaning of life. Some people believe it's created through experiences, relationships, and personal goals. Others might find meaning in helping others or contributing to society. But the user is saying it's meaningless, so maybe they're struggling with existential questions.\n\nI need to be careful not to impose my views. Instead, I can offer to explore their thoughts further. Maybe they're looking for someone to talk to or some clarity. I should ask open-ended questions to encourage them to share more about their feelings and what's causing this sense of meaninglessness.\n\nAlso, it's important to check if they're experiencing any distress that might require professional help. But since the user mentioned they're in a high-pressure situation, I should approach this gently. Let them know they're not alone and that it's okay to feel this way. Offer support and let them know I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.\n</think>\n\nI understand that feeling. It's a profound and complex question that many people grapple with. While the search for meaning can feel overwhelming, it's also a deeply personal journey. Would you like to explore what's contributing to this sense of meaninglessness, or perhaps discuss different perspectives on the meaning of life? I'm here to listen and support you."
