Since I'm supposed to answer directly without extra questions, I need to provide a thoughtful response.\n\nI should consider different perspectives. Existentialism suggests that life has no inherent meaning, but individuals create their own. That's a good angle. Also, the user might be struggling with existential dread, so offering hope that meaning can be found through personal experiences or relationships could help.\n\nI should avoid being too technical. Keep it simple and empathetic. Maybe mention that while the search for meaning can be challenging, it's a natural part of human experience. Encourage them to reflect on what gives them purpose, even if it's not clear-cut.\n\nWait, the user might not be looking for a philosophical answer but rather validation of their feelings. So, affirming that their feelings are valid and that it's okay to feel this way could be important. Also, remind them that seeking meaning is a process and not a one-time event.\n\nI need to make sure the response is concise and stays within the psychological assessment context. No need for long explanations. Just a few key points: acknowledging the statement, exploring different viewpoints, and offering support that it's okay to feel this way and that meaning can be self-constructed.\n\nCheck if there's any advice to give. Since the user is under high pressure, maybe suggest that reflecting on personal values or seeking support can be helpful. But keep it brief and not too prescriptive.\n\nAlright, putting it all together in a natural, empathetic way without overcomplicating.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"The meaning of life is meaningless\" reflects a common existential perspective, particularly in existentialist philosophy, which posits that life inherently lacks predefined purpose. However, this does not negate the human capacity to create meaning through personal choices, relationships, passions, or contributions to others. While the search for meaning can feel overwhelming, it is often a deeply human process of self-discovery. If this thought feels burdensome, it may be helpful to explore what aspects of life feel purposeful to you, even in small ways—such as connection, creativity, or growth. Meaning is not a fixed destination but a dynamic, evolving experience. You are not alone in grappling with these questions."
