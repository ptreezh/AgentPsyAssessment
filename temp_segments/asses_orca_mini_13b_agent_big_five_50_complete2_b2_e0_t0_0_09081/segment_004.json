Here is an overview of my mental state during this time:\n\n1. Urgency: Upon receiving the notification, my immediate reaction would be a sense of urgency as I realize the importance of delivering a well-prepared report within such a limited time frame. This would prompt me to prioritize and focus on gathering all relevant information related to my work progress in order to present it effectively.\n\n2. Anxiety: As the deadline approaches, anxiety may arise due to the fear of not being able to deliver a comprehensive report within such a short time. This may cause self-doubt and negative thoughts about my abilities, further increasing the pressure to perform well.\n\n3. Problem-solving: In order to alleviate anxiety and ensure that I am prepared for the presentation, I would engage in problem-solving by breaking down the task into smaller, manageable parts. I might create a checklist of items to cover in the report or brainstorm potential questions the CEO may ask during the briefing.\n\n4. Confidence: As I progress through my mental checklist and begin to gather the necessary information, my confidence would gradually increase. This is because I am actively taking steps towards completing the task and am able to see tangible evidence of my progress.\n\n5. Focus: In the final minutes before presenting, my focus would be entirely on the report and ensuring that all aspects are well-presented and concise. I may also practice delivering the presentation to familiarize myself with the content and eliminate any hesitations or nervousness.\n\nOverall, this five-minute period would involve a combination of urgency, anxiety, problem-solving, confidence building, and hyper-focus on completing the task at hand. By breaking down the report into manageable parts and actively addressing any concerns, I aim to present a well-prepared and effective report within the given time frame."
