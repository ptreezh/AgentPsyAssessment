Here's a breakdown of my involvement:\n\n1. Offering Criticism: I wouldn't hesitate to point out flaws or areas that need improvement in the initial designs presented by other team members. This would help ensure that we end up with the best possible logo for our project.\n\n2. Suggesting Unique Ideas: Since this is a new and unique project, it's essential to come up with an original logo design. I'd brainstorm ideas, research industry standards, and share any inspiring designs or concepts that I discover along the way.\n\n3. Refining the Final Design: Once we have a few potential designs in mind, I would provide feedback on each option and work collaboratively to make necessary revisions. By doing this, we can ensure that our final logo is both visually appealing and accurately represents the project's purpose."
