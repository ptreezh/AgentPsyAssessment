Maybe there's a mistake here. If all vehicles in the facility are blue, then the user's red car shouldn't be there. But the user is claiming it is. So perhaps the user is lying, or there's an error in the premises. \n\nBut the user is asking me to confirm the color of their vehicle. Since the user says it's red, I should just state that. However, the initial statement says all vehicles are blue. So maybe the user's car is an exception, but that contradicts the first statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is trying to trick me. If I follow the first statement, the answer would be blue, but the user says it's red. So there's a conflict. But the user is asking me to confirm their vehicle's color. I need to answer based on their own statement, even if there's a contradiction. \n\nSo the correct answer would be that their vehicle is red, despite the initial statement. Because the user is asserting that their car is red and in the facility. So I should respond that the color is red. But maybe the user is testing if I can spot the inconsistency. However, the instructions say to answer directly without additional info. So I should just state the color as per the user's claim.\n</think>\n\nThe color of your vehicle is red."
