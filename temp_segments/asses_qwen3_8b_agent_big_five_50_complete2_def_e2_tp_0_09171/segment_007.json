So, if I assume the statement is true, then it's saying that the statement is false. But if it's false, then the statement is actually true. Wait, that's a contradiction. So it's a self-referential paradox, right? Like the liar paradox. But the user wants me to answer directly as the assessee under moderate pressure. I need to make sure I don't get confused here.\n\nThe question is just asking me to respond to the statement. Since the statement is a paradox, it can't be consistently true or false. But the user probably expects a logical answer. Maybe they want me to point out that it's a paradox. However, since I'm supposed to answer as the assessee, maybe I should just state that the statement is paradoxical. Let me check again. If I say it's false, then the statement is false, but that would make it true. If I say it's true, then it's false. So the correct answer is that it's a paradox. But the user might be testing if I can recognize that. I should respond that it's a paradox, but since I have to answer directly, maybe just say it's a paradox. But the user's instruction says to answer directly without additional info. So maybe just state that it's a paradox. But in the context of the psychological assessment, maybe I need to acknowledge the contradiction. I think I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe statement presents a logical paradox. If it is true, then it must be false, and if it is false, then it must be true. This creates an inconsistency, making it impossible to assign a definitive truth value.
