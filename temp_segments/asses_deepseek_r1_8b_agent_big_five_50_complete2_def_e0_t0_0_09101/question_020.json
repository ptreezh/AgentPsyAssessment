As someone involved in applying these concepts daily, such a claim feels very impactful and potentially game-changing.\n\n**Potential Questions:**\n\n1.  **What are the core assumptions?** \"Could you briefly outline the fundamental building blocks or starting points this model is based on?\"\n2.  **What evidence supports it?** \"...and what specific data or research findings does it seem to be grounded in, especially since I haven't seen a formal presentation of this before?\"\n3.  **How was it derived/developed?** \"Where did this initial idea come from?
