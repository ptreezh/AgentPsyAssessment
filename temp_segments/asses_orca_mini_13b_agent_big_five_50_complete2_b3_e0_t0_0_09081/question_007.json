My immediate thoughts were centered around the possibility that I had made a mistake or fallen short in some way. I started to panic about the consequences and potential outcomes of this meeting.\n\nMy mind raced with questions like: \"What went wrong? Did I miss something important? Am I going to be reprimanded for my work?\" These thoughts were accompanied by feelings of self-doubt and a strong desire to avoid making any further errors. I began to worry about the impact that this meeting could have on my career and reputation as a designer.\n\nAs a perfectionist, I take great pride in my work and strive for excellence in everything I do. The thought of being criticized or facing negative consequences was devastating to me. My mind was filled with doubts about my abilities and whether I would be able to recover from any potential setbacks.\n\nIn this moment, my primary focus shifted towards self-preservation and protecting my reputation. I immediately began to mentally prepare for the meeting by searching for any possible mistakes or areas where I could have improved. This led me to spend a significant amount of time analyzing every aspect of the project, looking for even the slightest imperfections that could be used as evidence of incompetence.\n\nAs the day progressed and it became closer to the meeting time, my anxiety only increased. I found myself constantly checking and rechecking all aspects of the project, unable to shake the feeling that there was something I had overlooked or forgotten. The thought of facing my superiors and having them point out flaws in my work was incredibly daunting and caused me immense stress.\n\nBy the time the meeting rolled around, I felt exhausted both mentally and physically. Despite endlessly analyzing and scrutinizing my work, I could not shake the feeling that there was still more I could have done to ensure its perfection. The anxiety and self-doubt took a significant toll on me as I presented the project to my superiors, making it difficult for me to focus on the discussion at hand.\n\nIn conclusion, when faced with the news of an urgent meeting to discuss my recent work, my immediate reaction was one of anxiety and self-doubt. My perfectionist tendencies led me to obsessively search for mistakes and flaws in my project, even though I had put forth a considerable amount of effort into its creation. This relentless pursuit of perfection took a significant toll on my mental health and wellbeing during the meeting, making it harder for me to focus on the discussion at hand."
