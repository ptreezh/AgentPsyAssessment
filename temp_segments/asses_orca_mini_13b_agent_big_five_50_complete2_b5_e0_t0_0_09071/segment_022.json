I would make use of these resources to fill in any gaps in my knowledge and understand the material better.\n\n4. To maintain motivation, I would continue engaging in activities related to the skill I'm trying to learn.

By doing so, not only will I be able to gauge my progress but also build a portfolio of work that can demonstrate my competency in the subject matter.\n\n5. Lastly, it is crucial to set aside time for practice and self-reflection. I would regularly review my notes, code samples, and solutions to past exercises to identify areas where I need further improvement. This will help me address any difficulties timely and ensure that I am progressing in the right direction towards my long-term goal of learning a new skill.\n\nIn summary, when encountering challenges while learning a new skill, I would break down the goal into smaller objectives, actively seek resources to support my learning, engage with related activities, and regularly review my progress.
