If there is a planned program, such as speeches or presentations, I will actively listen and take notes on any key insights or ideas shared by the speakers.\n6.

As the evening winds down, I'll make sure to collect business cards from anyone who seems interesting or promising for future collaboration – and don't forget my own!\n8. Before leaving, I would thank the event organizers and express gratitude for the opportunity to meet so many new people – this will help me build a reputation as someone who is grateful, friendly, and fun at these events.\n9.
