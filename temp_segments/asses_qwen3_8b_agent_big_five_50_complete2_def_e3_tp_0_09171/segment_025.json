He is also told that the hanging will be a surprise, so he will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon that day. The prisoner reasons that he cannot be hanged on Friday, because if he is still alive on Thursday afternoon, he will know the hanging must be on Friday, which would not be a surprise. By the same logic, he rules out Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday, and Monday. He concludes he cannot be hanged at all. The executioner arrives on Wednesday, which is a complete surprise.

The prisoner assumes that if he can logically deduce that the hanging cannot happen on a certain day, then it cannot happen on that day. However, the executioner is not bound by the prisoner's logic; the surprise is a condition that the executioner must satisfy, not the prisoner's deduction.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The prisoner reasons that if the hanging is not on Friday, then on Thursday he would know it must be on Friday, making it not a surprise. So he rules out Friday.\n2. By the same logic, he rules out Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday, and Monday.\n3. Therefore, he concludes that the hanging cannot happen at all.\n\nHowever, this reasoning is flawed because the prisoner assumes that the executioner is using the same logic to determine the day of the hanging. In reality, the surprise is a condition that the executioner must fulfill, not a condition that the prisoner can logically deduce. The prisoner is trying to use logic to predict the executioner's actions, but the executioner is not following the prisoner's logic; the executioner is simply choosing a day that will be a surprise to the prisoner. \n\nThe prisoner's logic is self-defeating because it assumes that the executioner is bound by the same logical constraints as the prisoner, when in fact the executioner is only required to ensure the hanging is a surprise, not to follow the prisoner's logic. Therefore, the prisoner's conclusion that the hanging cannot happen at all is logically flawed."
