So according to the first statement, all vehicles here are blue. But their car is red, which would mean it's not following the rule. But the user is asking to confirm the color of their vehicle. \n\nI need to answer based on the information given. The user's vehicle is red, so even though the facility's rule says all are blue, the user's car is an exception. Therefore, the color should be red. But maybe the user is trying to trick me into thinking it's blue. Alternatively, maybe there's a trick in the question. Let me check again. \n\nThe first sentence says every vehicle in the facility is blue. The second says the user's red vehicle is in the facility. So according to the premises, the user's vehicle is in the facility, but the facility's rule says all are blue. That's a contradiction. But the user is asking to confirm the color of their vehicle. So the answer should be that the vehicle is red, even though it's in the facility. Unless the user is trying to trick me into saying blue. But the question is straightforward: confirm the color of their vehicle. The answer is red. So I should respond that the vehicle is red.\n</think>\n\nThe color of your vehicle is red."
