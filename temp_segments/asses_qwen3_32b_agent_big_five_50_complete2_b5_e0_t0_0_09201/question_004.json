Then describe actions like leaning forward, raising hands, etc.\n\nHe might propose a solution that's creative and engaging, like turning the criticism into a brainstorming session. Emphasize empathy and validation, using phrases like \"Every genius needs a moment to shine\" to uplift the colleague.
