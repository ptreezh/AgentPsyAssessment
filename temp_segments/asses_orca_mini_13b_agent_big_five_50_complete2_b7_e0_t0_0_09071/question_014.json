I might feel that the process was flawed or that those involved did not fully understand the significance of the proposal. \n\nAs an ESTJ personality type, I am likely to be highly dedicated to my work and take rejections personally. I would want to analyze what went wrong and find ways to improve both my proposal and future presentations. This could involve reaching out to colleagues for feedback or seeking support from superiors to understand the reasons for the rejection.\n\nThroughout the day, I might engage in self-reflection on how I can improve my approach in the future. I would likely review the proposal and any relevant materials, trying to identify areas where I could have done better or where more information was needed. I may also spend time researching alternative solutions or approaches that could be presented in a future proposal.\n\nIn order to maintain focus and motivation, I might set specific goals for improvement, such as obtaining feedback from at least three colleagues on the proposal or completing a draft of a revised version within a week. I would likely prioritize these goals over other tasks in order to ensure that I am better prepared for future presentations and proposals.\n\nThroughout this process, my primary focus would be on learning from the experience and improving both myself and my work. While disappointed, I am confident in my abilities and would not let this setback deter me from continuing to pursue innovative ideas and solutions in my role as a city hall archives and licensing department head."
