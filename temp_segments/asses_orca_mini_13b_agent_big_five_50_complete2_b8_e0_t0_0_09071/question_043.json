Break down the learning process into smaller, more manageable goals and create a plan of action to achieve them. This would involve setting achievable deadlines, identifying resources needed (books, online tutorials, etc.), and creating a schedule for practicing new skills.\n\n3.

For example, I might choose to practice coding by working on fun projects or participating in coding challenges.\n\n5.
