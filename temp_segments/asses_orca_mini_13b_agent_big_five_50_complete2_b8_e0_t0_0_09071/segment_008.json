The goal is to create a more relaxed atmosphere and break any tension that might have built up during the previous presentations.\n\nAdditionally, I would try to involve the audience members by asking for their thoughts on the topic or inviting them to share their own experiences related to it. This can help make the presentation feel more interactive and engaging, as well as giving everyone in the room a chance to feel heard and valued.\n\nFinally, I would summarize the main points of my presentation in an easy-to-understand manner and conclude by reiterating the importance or relevance of the information to the audience.
