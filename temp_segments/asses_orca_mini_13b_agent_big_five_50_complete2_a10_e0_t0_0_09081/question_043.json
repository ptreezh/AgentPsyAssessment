Here's why:\n\n1. Focus on practical application: My primary motivation lies in creating reliable, efficient, and durable things. By focusing on applying my new skills to practical projects or situations, I can maintain my interest and remain dedicated to achieving my goal.\n\n2. Seek help from others: If I find myself stuck on a particular concept or task, I would not hesitate to ask for help from colleagues or mentors who are proficient in the subject matter. Collaboration allows me to learn from experienced practitioners and benefit from their insights.\n\n3. Break down complex tasks into smaller ones: When faced with a challenging problem or task, I would break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This helps me approach the issue step-by-step, reducing its overall complexity and making it easier to find solutions.\n\n4. Practice through experimentation: Instead of solely relying on theoretical understanding, I would try implementing my new skills in real-world situations or projects. This allows me to gain practical experience and develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n\n5. Accept failures as learning opportunities: Failure is an unavoidable part of learning. Instead of becoming discouraged by setbacks, I would use them as opportunities for growth and reflection. By analyzing what went wrong, I can identify areas that need improvement and adjust my approach accordingly.\n\nIn summary, despite encountering difficulties during the learning process, I would persist in achieving my long-term goal by focusing on practical application, seeking help from others, breaking down complex tasks, practicing through experimentation, and accepting failures as opportunities for growth."
