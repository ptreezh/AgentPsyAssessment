Collaboration allows me to learn from experienced practitioners and benefit from their insights.\n\n3. Break down complex tasks into smaller ones: When faced with a challenging problem or task, I would break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This helps me approach the issue step-by-step, reducing its overall complexity and making it easier to find solutions.\n\n4. Practice through experimentation: Instead of solely relying on theoretical understanding, I would try implementing my new skills in real-world situations or projects.

Instead of becoming discouraged by setbacks, I would use them as opportunities for growth and reflection. By analyzing what went wrong, I can identify areas that need improvement and adjust my approach accordingly.\n\nIn summary, despite encountering difficulties during the learning process, I would persist in achieving my long-term goal by focusing on practical application, seeking help from others, breaking down complex tasks, practicing through experimentation, and accepting failures as opportunities for growth."
