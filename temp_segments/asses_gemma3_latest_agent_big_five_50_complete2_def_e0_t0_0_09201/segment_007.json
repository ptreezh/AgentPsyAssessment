It wasn’t just about the project itself; it felt like a personal failure. For the last few weeks, I’d poured everything into it – countless hours, research, refining the proposal… I genuinely believed it was solid.\n\nInitially, I just felt… numb. Like I was in a daze. I kept replaying the meeting in my head, trying to pinpoint exactly where it went wrong, but there was nothing obvious. I kept hearing the reviewer’s voice saying they didn’t see the value, and it just… stung.\n\nThen the disappointment morphed into frustration. I started thinking about all the effort I’d wasted. It felt incredibly unfair. I began to question my abilities, my judgment. Was I overestimating my ideas? Was I not presenting them effectively? \n\nAround lunchtime, I felt a surge of anger. It wasn’t directed at anyone specific, but it was a general, simmering anger at the situation, at the bureaucracy, at the perceived lack of understanding. I actually found myself wanting to argue, to defend my proposal, but I knew that wouldn't change anything. \n\nThroughout the afternoon, I've been trying to process it all. I've been walking around, just trying to keep busy to avoid dwelling on it. There’s a persistent feeling of self-doubt, and I keep thinking about how much time I've invested. I keep telling myself to move on, to learn from it, but it's difficult. It's a strange mix of sadness, frustration, and a little bit of shame. I just want to forget it happened, but I know that's not realistic."
