I’d likely experience a significant spike in anxiety, probably focusing on the fear of not being able to meet the new demands and potentially failing. I’d feel a sharp sense of urgency and probably a bit of panic.\n\nMy immediate response would be to try and understand *why* it increased. Is it a temporary project? Is there a systemic issue? I’d need to get clarification from my supervisor. \n\nThen, I’d prioritize. I'd make a very detailed list of everything I need to do, breaking each task down into smaller, manageable steps. I’d focus on identifying the absolute essential tasks and then tackle those first. I’d likely start communicating openly with my supervisor about the increased workload and my concerns, suggesting potential solutions if possible – perhaps re-prioritization or temporary assistance. I’d try to maintain a calm and professional demeanor, focusing on problem-solving rather than simply expressing frustration. I'd also be mindful of my own well-being and ensure I was taking short breaks to manage the stress."
