It’s normal to encounter difficulties when learning something new, especially a complex skill like a programming language. I’d take a step back and honestly assess *why* I’m struggling. Is it the material itself? My learning methods? Lack of time? I’d then break down my goals into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of focusing on mastering the entire language, I’d concentrate on learning specific concepts or building small projects. I’d actively seek help - online forums, tutorials, perhaps even finding a mentor. Importantly, I'd celebrate small successes to maintain motivation and remind myself that progress, however slow, is still progress. I’d also be willing to adjust my approach if something isn't working, and recognize that setbacks are a part of the learning process."
