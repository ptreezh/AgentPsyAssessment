I’d make sure I fully understand the key arguments and supporting evidence.\n\n2.  **Practice Slides (45 minutes):** I’d go through the slides *silently*, focusing on the flow and visual impact. I’d mentally rehearse the key points I want to make on each slide.\n\n3.  **Rehearse Key Sections Aloud (60 minutes):** I’d select the most critical sections – the opening, the main arguments, and the closing – and practice saying them out loud. I'd time myself to ensure I’m within the allotted presentation time.\n\n4.  **Anticipate Questions (30 minutes):** I'd brainstorm potential questions the client might ask and prepare concise, clear answers. I’d write these down.\n\n5.  **Technical Check (15 minutes):** I’d confirm the projector, laptop, and any audio equipment are working correctly. I’d ensure I know how to connect to the client’s system if necessary.\n\n6.  **Prepare Handouts (15 Minutes):** I’d create a brief handout summarizing the key takeaways from the presentation.\n\n7.  **Relaxation Technique (15 minutes):** A short mindfulness exercise or deep breathing to calm my nerves."
