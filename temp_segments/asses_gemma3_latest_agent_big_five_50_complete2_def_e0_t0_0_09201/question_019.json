I’d probably start by subtly reminding myself to refocus on the task at hand, trying to ignore the noise. If that didn’t work, I’d consider a polite, brief, and non-confrontational comment like, “Excuse me, could you please be a little quieter? It’s a bit distracting.” I’d try to keep my tone neutral and friendly, rather than accusatory. If the tapping continued after that, I’d likely try to move my workspace slightly to minimize the sound, or if possible, speak to my supervisor about the situation."
