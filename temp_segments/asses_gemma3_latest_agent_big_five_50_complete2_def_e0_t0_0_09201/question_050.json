Then, I’d brainstorm a wide range of initial concepts – sketching, digital mockups, exploring different styles – focusing on generating a large quantity of ideas. I’d present these initial ideas to the team for feedback, prioritizing those that resonated most strongly. We’d then refine the most promising concepts, iterating on color palettes, typography, and visual elements, always keeping the project goals at the forefront. I’d ensure clear communication and collaboration throughout the entire process to arrive at a truly unique and effective logo."
