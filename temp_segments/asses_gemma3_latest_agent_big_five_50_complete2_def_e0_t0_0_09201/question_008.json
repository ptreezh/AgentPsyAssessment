I’m immediately reviewing the last few days of work in my head, trying to pinpoint the *most* important accomplishments. I’m acutely aware of the CEO’s perspective – they likely have a busy schedule and want a concise overview. \n\nThere’s a strong urge to over-prepare, to anticipate every possible question. I’m battling that urge; I need to be efficient. I’m feeling a pressure to appear competent and in control, even if I’m internally scrambling. There's a slight feeling of self-doubt creeping in – *will I be able to summarize everything clearly and effectively?* \n\nMy breathing is probably becoming slightly shallower. I'm focusing intensely on my notes, trying to prioritize key points. I’m consciously attempting to maintain a calm and professional demeanor, but I’m aware of the underlying anxiety. It's a very concentrated state of focused pressure. I'm trying to appear confident, but truthfully, I’m just trying to get through it."
