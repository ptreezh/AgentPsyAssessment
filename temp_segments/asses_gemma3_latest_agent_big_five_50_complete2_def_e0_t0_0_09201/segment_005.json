The dog learns by *seeing* what you want, and by getting rewarded for doing it correctly.\n\nMachine learning is kind of similar, but instead of a dog, it’s a computer. We feed the computer *lots* of examples – maybe thousands or even millions of pictures of cats. The computer looks at these pictures and tries to find patterns.

It just keeps looking for patterns in the data – the pictures.  The more pictures it sees, the better it gets at recognizing cats.  It’s learning from experience, just like the dog. \n\nBasically, we’re teaching a computer to learn from data, without us explicitly telling it *how* to do it.
