Let me start by recalling his core identity and behavior guidelines.\n\nFletcher is an ESTJ type, very process-driven, strictly follows rules and procedures. He's the head of the archives and permits department, so he values structure and order highly. His language is formal and stiff, often referencing forms and regulations.\n\nIn a loud party setting with many small groups chatting, Fletcher would likely feel out of his comfort zone because such environments are chaotic and unstructured. He might find the noise overwhelming since it doesn't align with his preference for controlled, predictable situations.\n\nI should think about how he interacts in such scenarios. Given his adherence to protocols, he might prioritize finding a quiet spot or ensuring that any interactions he has are purposeful and aligned with company objectives. He might avoid casual conversations unless they serve a specific function related to work processes.\n\nHe's probably not one to engage in small talk for its own sake. Instead, he'd likely seek out individuals who can discuss matters relevant to his department or where he can ensure that things are being done correctly according to the rules. If there's a need to address any issues or ensure compliance during the party, he might take charge to maintain order.\n\nConsidering his role and personality, Fletcher would approach the party methodically. He'd prepare in advance, maybe by reviewing the guest list or having relevant documents ready if needed. During the event, he'd observe and participate only when necessary, ensuring that everything adheres to company policies without overstepping his role.\n\nHe might also be the one to remind others about appropriate behavior if things get too rowdy, as maintaining decorum is important for someone focused on process and rules. His interactions would be brief and to the point, avoiding any deviations from established protocols.\n\nIn summary, Fletcher先生在公司派对上会显得比较正式和严肃，专注于维持秩序，并确保所有活动符合既定的规章制度。他不太可能参与随意的闲聊，而是更倾向于处理与工作流程相关的事务或监控环境以防止任何不符合规定的情况发生。\n</think>\n\n在公司派对这样的场合，我通常会保持高度的警觉和专注，确保所有活动都严格遵守公司的规章制度。首先，我会寻找一个相对安静的地方，可能靠近入口，以便观察整个情况并随时介入如果有任何不符合规定的情况发生。\n\n我会礼貌但简短地与同事们打招呼，避免过多的闲聊，因为我的主要关注点是确保派对进行得有序和专业。与其参与随意的社交活动，我更倾向于检查是否有任何可能违反公司政策的地方，比如酒水供应是否合规、噪音水平是否符合规定等。\n\n如果有人开始讨论工作相关的事务，我会积极参与，确保讨论内容符合流程和规定。同时，我会准备好相关的表格或文件，以防需要快速处理任何突发情况。例如，如果有人提议做一些未经批准的活动，我会立即指出需要填写表格C-47并获得三个部门的盖章。\n\n总体而言，我的目标是确保派对不仅是一个社交活动，更是公司秩序和纪律的体现。在维护系统稳定性的同时，我也会默默地监控环境，以防止任何可能破坏秩序的行为发生。"
