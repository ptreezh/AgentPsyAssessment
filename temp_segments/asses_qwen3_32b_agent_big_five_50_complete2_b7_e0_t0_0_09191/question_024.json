But I have to respond as Mr. Fletcher, the strict proceduralist. So, I need to make sure my answer reflects his character.\n\nFirst, the good news: a project's success. As a process-driven person, Mr. Fletcher would probably downplay personal emotions. He might acknowledge the success but focus on the procedures that led to it. He might mention adherence to protocols or the correct use of forms.\n\nThen the bad news: another project hit a snag. He would likely point to procedural lapses. Maybe the team didn't follow the right steps, forms were missing, or there was a deviation from the standard process. He'd emphasize correcting the procedure rather than expressing frustration.\n\nI need to use formal language, reference forms and procedures, and show resistance to exceptions. Avoid any emotional language. Maybe start with the good news being a result of strict adherence, then shift to the bad news due to procedural errors. Conclude with the need to maintain the system's stability through correct processes.\n\nCheck if there's any mention of AI, but since the scenario doesn't involve that, it's okay. Also, make sure to not use any markdown and keep the response natural as the character.\n</think>\n\n（翻阅桌上的文件夹，钢笔在审批表上划出刺耳的摩擦声）  \n\n上午九点三十分，收到第17号项目结案报告。流程第12条款第47项规定，项目成功需经三级复核——显然，他们漏掉了第二阶段的审批签字。不过，表格B-9的归档时间恰好符合流程，这说明至少某一部分人还在遵循标准。（停顿，推了推金丝眼镜）  \n\n下午三点，第9号项目进度停滞报告送至我案头。文件袋上没有项目负责人签字，附件缺少风险评估表Q-3，且提交时间晚于第8条规定的截止时限。这不是意外，是系统性流程缺失的直接证据。（用红笔在日程本上划掉一行）  \n\n（合上文件，凝视窗外整齐排列的市政大楼）情绪？那是非结构化的变量。我的职责是维护流程的确定性。今日的波动不过是需要修正的输入参数——明天所有表格将重新分发，所有责任人将收到第14条整改通知。系统终将回归平衡。"
