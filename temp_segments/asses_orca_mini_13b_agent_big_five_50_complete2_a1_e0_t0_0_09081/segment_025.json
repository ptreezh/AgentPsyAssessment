Research best practices for designing effective logos, taking into account factors such as color psychology, typography, and visual simplicity.

For example, one person could be responsible for researching font options, while another focuses on creating sketches or digital mock-ups.\n\n4. Create a system for organizing and sharing design ideas among the team members. This might involve using a shared folder in our document management system or hosting regular design \"critiques\" where everyone can provide feedback.\n\n5.
