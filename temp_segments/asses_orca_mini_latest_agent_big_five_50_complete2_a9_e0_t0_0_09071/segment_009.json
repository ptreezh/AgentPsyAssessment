Listen actively: Once you have introduced yourself and your role in the team, take the time to listen carefully to your new colleague. Ask open-ended questions and let them express themselves without judgment. This will help them feel heard and understood.\n\n2. Be supportive: Offer positive feedback and encouragement to your team member. Highlight their strengths and achievements, and offer suggestions for how they can improve.
