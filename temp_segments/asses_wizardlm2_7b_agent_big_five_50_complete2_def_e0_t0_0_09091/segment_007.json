This emotion was predominant upon leaving the review committee meeting, as I had invested considerable time and effort into preparing the proposal, believing it to be a solid contribution to our collective goals.\n\nUpon reflecting, my feelings shifted towards a more analytical perspective. I recognized that the decision wasn't entirely personal; it could be due to various factors such as resource allocation, alignment with organizational priorities, or perhaps other proposals of higher priority. I allowed myself a moment to feel the sting of rejection, but I also reminded myself that setbacks are part of any professional journey.\n\nThroughout the day, my emotions oscillated between disappointment and determination. I felt a temporary loss of motivation, but I quickly channeled this energy into reviewing the feedback provided by the committee. This constructive criticism became a guide for personal growth and improvement in my work.\n\nI spent some time engaging in activities that help me cope with stress, such as going for a walk or practicing mindfulness. This helped to clear my head and regain a sense of perspective. I believed that this experience could be an opportunity to refine my proposal and perhaps resubmit it at a later date when the timing might be more favorable.\n\nBy the end of the day, I had formulated a plan to address the concerns raised during the review. I felt a renewed sense of purpose and was eager to start working on these improvements. The rejection didn't define my abilities or potential; rather, it served as a stepping stone towards refining my approach and enhancing the project proposal for future consideration.\n\nOverall, my day was a mix of emotions, from initial disappointment to a more balanced view of the situation, leading to a constructive and proactive mindset moving forward."
