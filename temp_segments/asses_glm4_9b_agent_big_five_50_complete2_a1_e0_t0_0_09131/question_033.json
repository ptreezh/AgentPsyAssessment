I would prioritize tasks that have longer lead times or are more complex.\n\n4. **Set Deadlines:** Assign deadlines for each sub-task, ensuring they are realistic and allow for potential delays or unforeseen issues.\n\n5. **Resource Allocation:** Identify the resources needed to complete the task, including personnel, equipment, and budget.

This includes considering what could go wrong and how to mitigate those risks.\n\n7. **Review Existing Data/Information:** If there is existing data or information relevant to the task, review it thoroughly to inform decisions and save time later on.\n\n8. **Communication Plan:** Develop a plan for communicating progress and any issues to stakeholders.
